Protein concentrations were the highest in C. idella and C. catla and the lowest in C. carpio. Considering protein profiles mucus samples from C. catla contained the highest molecular weight proteins while C. carpio has one unique protein band of 14.13 kDa the weight of which resembles the weight of lysozyme, a protective element of mucus. Lectin activity was highest in C. idella indicative of low resistance while it was the lowest in H. molitrix. Alkaline phosphatase level was the highest in C. catla, and was the lowest in C. carpio. Overall results indicted C. carpio as the most resistant species as it showed better values for the immune components. Higher values of protein contents and alkaline phosphatase for C. catla may be in favor of its higher susceptibility. These studies on mucus contents are good assessment indicators of the possibility of parasitic attacks in Chinese and Indian major carps."

Collagen for this research was extracted from silver carp skin and thin films were fabricated by the solution casting methods. The structure of films was researched using infrared spectroscopy. The surface properties of films were investigated using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and contact angle measurements. Mechanical properties were measured as well. It was found that the addition of xanthohumol and propanediol modified the roughness of collagen films and their mechanical properties. UV irradiation led to the water loss from the film and modification of the collagen structure. In the presence of propanediol and xanthohumol the water loss after UV irradiation was smaller than in UV-irradiated collagen films without these additives."

Alternatively, ad hoc inferences from sparse occurrence records leave biologists to face conservation decisions with high uncertainty. Simple predictive models can fill the gap between these two alternatives. One method to predict the probable range of riverine fishes is to add the average distance between occurrences to the most distal occurrence (parametric estimator). However, there are drawbacks to this method when the distances between occurrences deviate from a non‐uniform distribution. Herein, estimators that are robust to non‐uniformity, a non‐parametric and an optimal linear estimator, were adapted and compared to the parametric estimator using simulations. The non‐parametric estimator showed the least bias and variance in bias for the probable range endpoint. The optimal linear estimator best balanced type I and type II errors in the maximum probable range estimate (i.e., upper CI). Application of the robust estimators were made to demonstrate how sampling can be planned based on available effort (Gulf Coast walleye, Sander vitreus) and where early detection sampling may be focused (silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). This study provides biologists with a suite of simple options (R code provided as supplementary material) to bridge the gap between ad hoc inference and complex modeling over a range of scenarios. Future studies should focus on accounting for false‐positives, variable effort, and develop online apps for accessibility."	"10.1002/rra.3969"	"internal-pdf://1253175004/Aldridge-2022.pdf"

Previous studies suggest that suitable BHC habitat is limited to a few productive, nearshore areas. However, those studies did not consider the influence of BHC's diet plasticity or the presence of spatially-discrete subsurface prey resources. This study aimed to characterise Lake Michigan's suitability for BHC and evaluate the importance of these considerations in habitat suitability assessments. We used simulated outputs of prey biomass (phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detritus) and water temperature from a three-dimensional biophysical model of Lake Michigan to evaluate growth rate potential (GRP, quantitative index of habitat suitability) of adult BHC throughout the entire volume of the lake. Our GRP model applied a foraging model and a bioenergetics model to translate prey concentrations and water temperatures into habitat quality indexed by individual fish growth rate. We defined suitable habitat as habitats that can support GRP >= 0 g g(-1) day(-1). We developed six feeding scenarios to evaluate the impact of diet flexibility and subsurface prey resources on suitable habitat quantity. Scenarios were defined by the number of prey types the fish could consume and the depths at which they could feed (surface or whole water column). Consistent with previous studies, we found that habitats with the highest quality were concentrated near river mouths and in eutrophic areas of Green Bay. However, in contrast to previous studies, we found suitable offshore habitat for bighead carp owing to our added considerations of diet plasticity and subsurface prey resources. For silver carp, these considerations extended suitable habitat within Green Bay and in some tributary-influenced nearshore areas, but offshore areas remained predominantly unsuitable in all feeding scenarios. Differences in simulated habitat suitability between these two species probably reflect differences in energy density and mass of the specific fishes we used in our model. However, reports of these two species in environments where they coexist indicate that bighead carp grow at faster rates than silver carp, as our model simulated. Our vertical analysis at Muskegon, MI, U.S.A. indicates that subsurface temperature and prey biomass are not only sufficient to support bighead carp growth but provide maximum habitat quality during late summer stratification. Overall, our study demonstrates that BHC are capable of surviving and growing in much larger areas of Lake Michigan than predicted by previous studies, and thus suggests that the risk of establishment is not sufficiently reduced by low plankton concentrations. Maps generated by our model identified the potential for cross-lake migration corridors that may facilitate and accelerate lake-wide movements. We believe these maps could be used to prioritise surveillance protocols by identifying areas to which BHC might spread upon entering the lake. More broadly, this research demonstrates how the physiology and trophic ecology of BHC contributes to their high invasive capacity and can permit their survival in novel environments."

BigheadHypophthalmichthys nobilisand Silver CarpH. molitrix, collectively 'bigheaded carps' (BHC), are planktivorous fishes threatening to invade Lake Michigan. While previous studies indicate the lake contains habitat suitable for BHC growth, there is a need to understand how anthropogenic-driven changes to the abiotic and biotic environment could alter its vulnerability to BHC. We applied a spatially explicit model of BHC growth rate potential (GRP; g g(-1)d(-1)) to nine biophysical model scenarios to evaluate changes in habitat suitability in Lake Michigan. Scenarios differed in meteorology (cool, reference, warm), annual tributary phosphorus loads (0, 3300, and 5600 MTA), and the presence/absence of invasive dreissenid mussels. Mussel effects on BHC GRP relied on their contact with the surface mixed layer (SML), the depth of which was affected by meteorology. The warm year advanced the expansion of Bighead Carp habitat by increasing temperature-dependent foraging rates and lessening the time of competitive interaction with mussels due to earlier stratification separating mussels from the SML. Phosphorus loads were the most influential driver of the lake's suitability. Compared to present conditions, we estimate BHC could have grown an additional 8-40% annually in the 1980s when mussels were not in the lake and phosphorus loads were higher. Our study demonstrates how climate change and nutrient enrichment can increase Lake Michigan's vulnerability to BHC by affecting thermal regime and productivity, thereby limiting negative effects of dreissenid mussels on BHC growth."

To prevent their continued spread upstream toward the Great Lakes, intense commercial harvest was implemented on the Illinois River, a large tributary that connects the Mississippi River to Lake Michigan. Since implementation, harvest has reduced densities at the invasion front while also presenting an opportunity to generate a synthesis on ecosystem resilience in the face of accelerating invasion. Resilience, the ability of an ecosystem to recover after perturbation, was observed at local scales and within some taxa but has yet to manifest at a river-wide scale and often co-varied with abiotic environmental or seasonal factors. Thus, while intensive harvest has limited further spread of bigheaded carps, and evidence of additional secondary ecosystem benefits exists, opportunities remain to identify potential pathways that could spread such ecosystem benefits even farther."

Comparative studies assessing a wide number of digestive enzymes on fishes that compete for food resources are lacking, especially in the context of an introduced species. It is generally thought that the invasive silver carp (SVC; Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) directly compete for food resources with the native gizzard shad (GZS; Dorosoma cepedianum) in waters where they coexist. We compared 19 digestive enzymes between SVC and GZS throughout a year and in two rivers in the Midwestern United States: Illinois River and Wabash River. All digestive enzymes analyzed were detected in both SVC and GZS in both rivers. However, the profiles of the digestive enzymes varied by species. Alkaline phosphatase, valine arylamidase, acid phosphatase, naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase and N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase were all much higher in SVC than in GZS. Differences between digestive enzyme profiles were also observed between rivers and months. This study demonstrates the utility of using an ecological approach to compare physiological features in fishes."	"10.1007/s10228-018-0615-x"	"internal-pdf://0718569805/GICa4"

Bigheaded Carp recruited in large numbers in the LaGrange Reach of the Illinois River during the summer of 2014. This provided an opportunity to determine whether native piscivorous fish prey upon invasive carp when they are abundant. Using electrofishing and fyke nets in the LaGrange Reach (August 1-November 8, 2014), we sampled native predatory fish (n = 1,472) for stomach content analysis. Fish community data from the Upper Mississippi River Restoration Program's Long-Term Resource Monitoring was used to quantify prey abundance (fish < 100 mm) in the study area and indicated that bigheaded carp represented 9% of available prey. Stomach content analysis revealed that the frequency of occurrence of juvenile bigheaded carp was greater than 15% in Shortnose Gar Lepisosteus platostomus, White Bass Morone chrysops, Black Crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus, Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus, Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu, Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, White Crappie Pomoxis annularis, Yellow Perch Perca flavescens, Flathead Catfish Pylodictis olivaris, Freshwater Drum Aplodinotus grunniens, and Yellow Bass Morone mississippiensis. Predators sampled in August and September foraged more heavily on juvenile bigheaded carp than those sampled in October and November. Electivity analysis suggested that juvenile bigheaded carp were selected over native forage by White Bass, Black Crappie, and Shortnose Gar, as these predators continued consuming them even as availability declined. Our results imply that native piscivores in the Illinois River consume and sometimes prefer juvenile bigheaded carp as prey. These results suggest that native predators might play a role in regulating bigheaded carp recruitment and that negative impacts to predators in areas of dense carp populations might be somewhat mitigated by the consumption of juvenile bigheaded carp."

Population abundance upstream of Lock and Dam (LD) 19 (LD19) on the upper Mississippi River (UMR) has likely been limited by the high‐head dam at this location, which restricts all upstream fish passage to the lock chamber. We measured otolith (lapillus) stable isotope composition and elemental microchemistry of 146 Silver Carp (n = 77 females, 69 males) and 141 Bighead Carp (n = 76 females, 65 males) to determine early life environments (ELEs) of adult bigheaded carp captured upstream of LD19 at the invasion front, in an area of intense management (Pools 16–19). Otolith oxygen isotope ratios (δ18O) and elemental ratios (Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca) were compared to values of isotope and elemental ratios in water from putative ELEs to assign the ELE for each fish. Most Bighead Carp (68.8%) and Silver Carp (54.1%) collected upstream of LD19 had otolith core signatures consistent with ELEs downstream of LD19. Nineteen percent of Bighead Carp and 34% of Silver Carp could not be classified. The sex ratios of bigheaded carp (Pools 17–19 combined) with otolith core signatures downstream of LD19 did not differ from 1:1. Our results, when compared to those of Whitledge et al.

To explore the influence of environmental factors on eDNA particle size distribution (PSD), we manipulated fish communities across nine experimental ponds, which led to differences in a suite of environmental covariates (biochemical oxygen demand, chlorophyll a concentration, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, and turbidity) over 5 months. At the end of the experiment, we serially filtered water samples from each pond through 5 filter sizes (20, 10, 5, 1, and 0.2 µm) followed by eDNA precipitation. We used quantitative PCR to determine the proportion of Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) or bigheaded carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and H. nobilis) eDNA captured within each size fraction. Based on eDNA concentrations recorded at each size fraction, we parameterized a Weibull distribution to describe the eDNA PSD of each species in each pond. Likelihood ratio tests suggested that PSD did not differ between species but did differ across ponds. Stepwise multiple regressions indicated that the specific environmental factors with the greatest influence on PSD differed depending on the pore size of the filter used for capture. Notably, positive associations with chlorophyll and turbidity were most important for predicting capture with a 10‐µm filter, suggesting that eDNA is sticky, and the presence of relatively large particles such as algal cells or other suspended sediments can dramatically alter eDNA PSD. Therefore, we advocate that researchers and managers consider analysis of eDNA PSD within their study systems to optimize eDNA capture efficiencies and increase detection probabilities across variable biotic and abiotic conditions. Furthermore, reporting eDNA PSD evaluations across more diverse systems has the potential to reveal broader patterns of eDNA capture efficiency and improve research and natural resource management with eDNA applications."

Research and development of new invasive species barriers is often evaluated in pond and field scales using high-resolution telemetry data. Telemetry data sets can be a rich source of data about fish movement and behavior but can be difficult to analyze due to the size of these data sets as well as their irregular sampling intervals. Due to the challenges, most barrier studies only use summary endpoints, such as barrier passage counts or average (e.g., mean or median) fish distance from the barrier, to describe the data. To examine more fine-scale fish movement patterns, we developed a first-order Markov chain. We then used this model to help understand the impacts of a barrier on fish behavior. For our study system, we used data from a previous study examining how bighead and silver carp (two invasive fish species in the United States) responded to a carbon dioxide (CO2) barrier in a pond. Considerations for management Based upon our findings, management considerations include: Markov chains can be used to describe and quantify movement patterns of aquatic organisms responding to barriers. These models provide insight not possible with previously used summary approaches. The CO(2)barrier changed both the locations of fish and movement patterns of fish. The changes in movement were not captured using conventional endpoints. Specifically, fish had less random movement patterns during periods of CO(2)exposure. This provides evidence that bighead and silver carp actively avoided areas with CO(2)and also shows that our approach can help assess random versus nonrandom movements"	"10.1111/nrm.12281"	"internal-pdf://1045201370/Borland-2020.pdf"

Changes in species dominance has been documented by a 25-year fish community dataset encompassing six reaches of the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. Specifically, common carp (Cyprinus carpio) abundance has declined across all reaches, whereas silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) have increased in abundance in the southern three reaches. To test whether signals in the data were consistent with regime transitions, changes in body-size patterns and trends in functional biomass and variance of functional biomass of the fish community were assessed. I further explored biomass thresholds relative to transitions. Shifts in body-size aggregations and trends in functional biomass support hypotheses that transitions from common carp dominance to a more functional diverse community represent alternate regimes. Results indicate such transitions occurred in the early 2000s for the two most northern reaches, and that the third most northern reach is nearing this transition. In the southern reaches, results indicate that transitions from common carp dominance to silver and bighead carp dominance also represent alternate regimes. Regime transitions support biomass thresholds between 8000 and 10,000 g per unit of day electrofishing effort of common carp and between 20 and 2000 g per unit effort in silver and bighead carp. Consistencies across reaches with similar dominance patterns provide support that reinforcing feedbacks, unique to the functional attributes of the dominant species, occur at similar biomass levels.

Understanding these dynamics is important when assessing the impacts of invasive species, such as bighead carp, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, and silver carp, H. molitrix, (bigheaded carp). These species have established throughout much of the Mississippi River Basin; however, Lock and Dam 19 (LD19) has slowed their establishment in the Upper Mississippi River, resulting in low-density populations with limited reproduction upstream. The age and growth of Bigheaded Carp in recently established populations, especially in this region, are poorly characterized. Therefore, we compared the age and growth of bigheaded carp for four low-density navigation pools of the Mississippi River near the invasion front with one long-established high-density population, separated by LD19. To assess growth rates and age at maturity, we estimated consensus age from pectoral spines, postcleithra, and vertebrae from 1229 bigheaded carp, 30 fish per 50 mm size class. Length at age of capture and back-calculated length-at-age were used to create growth curves using VBGC analysis. The analysis indicated higher growth rates of bighead carp and silver carp upstream of Lock and Dam 19 than downstream. Comparison of growth models with a likelihood ratio test indicated differences in length at time zero between the pools for bighead carp but not for silver carp. However, maximum length and growth rates were significantly different for silver carp upstream and downstream of the dam but not for bighead carp.

The area of reservoirs varied from 0.12 to 3.71 ha, average depth varied from 1.12 to 2.4 m. The analysis of hydrobiological material in accordance with existing criteria has been carried out. Total and seasonal concentration and biomass of phytoplankton, zooplankton and benthos are determined. During observation period in composition of algocenosis prevailed representatives of following groups of algae: Volvocophyceae, Desmidiales, Bacillariophyta, Xanthophyta, Zygnematophyceae, Chrysophyta, Pyrrophyta, Protococcophyceae, Cyanophyta, Euglenophyta. Concentration of algae in ponds varied from 0.58 up to 6.78 mln/l, total biomass varied from 0.87 to 9.70 mg/l. Zooplankton of the inspected ponds was represented by species of three systematic groups: Rotatoria, Cladocera and Copepoda. Concentration of zooplankton organisms varied from 0.0055 to 3.9432 mln/m3, biomass varied from 0.05 to 18.60 g/m3. Zoobenthos included Oligochaeta, Clitellata and insect larvae (Chironomidae, Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera). Prevalence of various representatives of plankton groups depended on the season of the year. In zoobentos samples there were found oligochaeta, chironomid and mayfly larvae, caddisflies and leeches. Higher plants were represented by 8 hydrophytic species, 1 species with floating leaves and 10 aerial coastal species. Ichthyofauna of ponds included 12 species among which aborigen species were common carp, crucian carp, roach, bream, tench, verkhovka, Amur sleeper, pike, perch, pike-perch; invasive species were grass carp, silver carp. The investigations of the large Golytsinsky pond have demonstrated that episodic releases of silver carp (spotted and hybrid) make possible to utilize both zooplankton and phytoplankton, and release of grass carp helps utilize higher water plants."

SDS-PAGE revealed high molecular weight protein crosslinks in apple pectin treated surimi gels and disappearance of myosin bands in konjac glucomannan treated surimi gels. The water holding capacity of surimi was the highest when 0.075 g/100 g of apple pectin was added. Konjac glucomannan treated gels exhibited superior whiteness values. The analysis of soluble protein revealed that hydrophobic bonds increased in both the treatments. The hardness values of pectin gels enhanced as the level increased. Other TPA parameters are shown an inconsistent trend.

The characteristic organs called gill rakers (GRs), found in many such filter feeders, facilitate the efficient filtration of food particles such as phytoplankton that are of a few microns in size. The motivation to investigate the rheology of the GR mucus stems from our desire to understand its role in aiding the filter feeding process in the silver carp. The mucus-rich fluid, in a 'thick and sticky' state may facilitate the adhesion of food particulates. The permeation and transport through the GR membrane are facilitated by the action of external shear forces that induce varying shear strain rates. Therefore, mucus rheology can provide a vital clue to the tremendous outcompeting nature of the silver carp within the pool of filter feeding fish. Based on this it was posited that GR mucus may provide an adhesive function to food particles and act as a transport vehicle to assist in the filter feeding process. The main objective of the protocol is to determine the yield stress of the mucus, attributed to the minimum shear stress required to initiate flow at which irreversible plastic deformation is first observed across a structured viscoelastic material. Accordingly, rheological properties of the GR mucus, i.e., viscosity, storage, and loss moduli, were investigated for its non-Newtonian, shear-thinning nature using a rotational rheometer. A protocol presented here is employed to analyze the rheological properties of mucus extracted from the gill rakers of a silver carp, fished at Hart Creek location of the Missouri River. The protocol aims to develop an effective strategy for rheological testing and material characterization of mucus assumed to be a structured viscoelastic material."

We conducted an experiment to assess whether fish herding using percussive sound or electrical stimuli can enhance catch rates and detection of bigheaded carp and other fishes in surface-to-bottom gill nets. Catch rates (fish net set(-1)) from traditional gill net sets where no herding method was applied were compared to sets combined with either sound stimuli (physical impacts to the boat hull and water surface to produce percussive sound) or electricity produced from a pulsed-DC electrofisher to manipulate fish movements. For most species, herding increased catch rates and detection probability compared to control sets. Sound stimuli increased catch rates of Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) by over three times, whereas electrical stimuli increased catch rates by over six times. Catch of Bighead Carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) was highest in nets paired with sound stimuli. Herding methods also reduced the number of samples required to attain target detection probabilities for bigheaded carp. Herding techniques combined with gill netting may be a valuable option for targeted bigheaded carp sampling, especially when electrofishing or netting alone is ineffective for these evasive fishes. Synergistic methods may provide a cost effective means of improving detection probabilities for bigheaded carp at their invasion front or other locations where densities are low and uncertainty of capture is high."

Recent technological advances in telemetry transmitters has increased the availability of tags sufficiently small enough to implant in juvenile carps. However, the effects of surgical implantation of telemetry tags on juvenile bigheaded carps have not been evaluated. We determined tag retention and survival associated with surgical implantation of acoustic telemetry tags into juvenile bighead carp (range 128-152 mm total length) at three temperatures (13, 18, and 23 degrees C). In addition, we assessed the effect of surgically implanted transmitters on the fitness, defined as changes in weight or critical swimming speed, of carp implanted with transmitters.

In the forty years before 2009, cyanobacteria frequently bloomed in WY Lake, an event which has not occurred since 2009. The stocking density of filter-feeding carp was estimated to be more than 50 g/m3 in July after 2009, approximately double the amount observed before 2009, and the ratio of silver carp to bighead carp (SBR) increased from 0.8 to more than 1.6. Compared with the water quality between 2004 and 2007, the total nitrogen (TN) and the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration decreased while total phosphorus (TP) and transparency (SD) increased significantly after 2009 (P < 0.05). The decreasing Chl-a concentration was observed in Jul, Jun, May, Jul, and Mar in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2016, and 2017, respectively. The Chl-a concentration was significantly negatively correlated with TP (P < 0.05), and no significant correlation with TN was observed (P > 0.05). A significant negative correlation was observed between fish yield and SD (P < 0.05). The results also showed that filter-feeding carp more effectively restrained algae growth when SD was low. These results indicated that a high density of filter-feeding fish with increased SBR interfered with the driving effects of nutrients and temperature on the growth of algal biomass and then restrained bloom of algae. It may be necessary to take SD into consideration for determining the appropriate fish stocking density for the biomanipulation of algae."

Alternatively, naturally free-flowing tributaries could offer alternative habitat for successful reproduction. Our objectives were to examine temporal and spatial variation in adult gonad development, ichthyoplankton densities, and back-calculated spawn dates of invasive carp collected in three UMR tributaries. We compared ichthyoplankton densities between the upstream and mouth reaches of tributaries and densities between the UMR and adjacent tributaries. Ichthyoplankton samples were collected every 10 d, and adult invasive carp were sampled monthly at nine sites throughout the Des Moines, Skunk, Iowa, Cedar, and Mississippi rivers during April-October 2014 and 2015. Peaks in adult gonadosomatic index, an increase in postspawn females, and ichthyoplankton collections suggested that peak spawning occurred during late May through June, when water temperatures were 18-30 degrees C and channel velocities were at least 0.7 m/s. However, reproduction occurred as late as August in some tributaries. Ichthyoplankton densities were highest in the Des Moines River among tributaries, but tributary densities were similar to the UMR densities, suggesting that both tributaries and main-stem sites provide suitable spawning locations. Invasive carp reproduction in UMR tributaries provides additional sources of potential recruitment for further population expansion upstream in the UMR and should be considered when devising plans for controlling populations along the leading edge of the invasion."

While refuting the long-standing notion that riverine zooplankton communities are numerically depauperate and spatially homogeneous, this also shows that the importance of abiotic and biotic drivers and the consistency of ecological patterns are still poorly understood for these communities. We collected zooplankton along 300 km of the Illinois River for 5 years to test the influence of a suite of biotic and abiotic variables on zooplankton density, biomass, and diversity. We hypothesized abiotic variables such as temperature, turbidity, and velocity would be predominant predictors, with biotic variables like planktivory becoming important when physical factors do not constrain them. Results showed basin-wide declines in zooplankton taxonomic richness as planktivory from the invading silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) increased. In contrast, density and biomass were explained by abiotic factors at the basin scale, with velocity, turbidity, and pH driving biomass and velocity driving density. We also found that both the driving factors and the plankton responses varied among the upper, middle, and lower sections of the Illinois River. We conclude that while zooplankton communities of the Illinois River are highly structured in space, the driving forces behind their distribution patterns are not simple. Instead, there is a complex spatio-temporal template of biological, chemical, and hydraulic factors shaping these communities in the Illinois River. Along with emphasizing the importance of spatial heterogeneity in large river ecosystems, these results also support a growing view that invasive species interactions can supersede the well-established role of abiotic factors in explaining global freshwater diversity losses. This also highlights the importance of including long-term zooplankton sampling in ecological monitoring programs in diverse and productive large river systems like the Illinois."

We measured individual metabolic rate (ṀO2) and calculated the routine metabolic rate (RMR), Q10 and critical oxygen tension (Pcrit) after two weeks of acclimation at either 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 °C. Gill morphology was also examined. A variety of Pcrit responses was observed: the Pcrit increased (qing bo), decreased (Chinese bream and grass carp) or was conserved (big head carp, silver carp and common carp) with increasing acclimation temperatures (10 - 30 °C). Apparent thermal-induced gill remodeling was found in three (grass carp, big head carp and silver carp) of the six cyprinids studied, with common carp also exhibiting some degree of gill structure modification. RMR was positively correlated with Pcrit at temperatures ranging from 10 to 30 °C in qing bo and big head carp; however, such significant correlation was not found in the remaining cyprinids, possibly due to their gill remodeling potential during thermal changes and thus an increased lamellar surface area at higher temperatures."

However, only a little information regarding the effectiveness of the enhancement program has been reported. In this context, this study investigates on an enhancement program through monitoring the efficacy based on parentage analysis. Methods A total of 1,529 hatchery-reared fish and 869 larvae were sampled from the middle Yangtze River in 2016 and 2017 and were genotyped by thirteen microsatellite loci. Based on the results of parentage analysis the larvae were divided into three populations: (1) larvae population with both parents being hatchery-reared fish (=R), (2) larvae population with only a male or a female parent being hatchery-reared fish (=H), and (3) larvae population with no hatchery-reared fish parent (=W). The following analyses were also carried out: (1) assessing the contribution of hatchery-reared offspring to larval resources, and (2) evaluating the genetic effect of stock enhancement on the wild population. Results In total, 10.37% and 11.56% of larvae were identified as the offspring produced by hatchery-reared fish released in 2016 and 2017, respectively. In 2017, some of the larvae were assigned unambiguously to hatchery-reared fish released in 2016. In terms of the number of offspring produced, the hatchery-reared fish have shown significant variations. No significant differences were found among all the larvae populations concerning genetic parameters for diversity. High levels of genetic diversity of all larvae populations were obtained. Low FSTvalues obtained from pairwise FST analysis, as well as the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), revealed high genetic structural similarity among all the larvae populations. The genetic composition of the W larvae population in 2017 was different from that of all other larvae populations (all larvae populations in 2016, and R and H larvae populations in 2017), as demonstrated from the results of STRUCTURE and PCA analyses. Conclusion It was demonstrated that hatchery-reared fish are successful in producing the offspring in the natural environment during multiple years, which might assist in increasing the abundance of larvae. The hatchery-reared fish had variations in terms of the success rates on reproduction. Also, the hatchery-reared enhancement program had no significant effect on the genetic diversity or the genetic structure of wild populations. However, the genetic component of the W larvae population in 2017 was changed as compared to 2016, which was not due to the hatchery-reared enhancement program for silver carp. This could be due to flooding, but the specific causes need further studies. Our results clearly show the necessity to continuously inspect the genetic impact of the enhancement program so that historical information can be utilized for further research."

Flow velocity has been recognized to affect the spawning of fishes delivering drifting eggs in rivers. However, solid scientific supports and associated mechanisms to establish quantitative relations between flow velocity and fish reproduction, taking into account spawning, fertilizing, hatching, as well as surviving, are lacking. In this paper, we quantified the relationship between flow velocity and reproduction of Chinese carps through both lab and field experiments. The results showed that a minimum velocity was required to trigger Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (H. molitrix) releasing eggs, and a velocity range was preferred to sustain spawning activity. However, the embryo incubation and larvae development of H. molitrix were found to be inhibited with the increase in flow velocity. Considering the requirements of spawning and hatching, as well as larvae surviving, an optimized flow velocity processes was identified for the reproduction of H. molitrix in rivers. These findings were of great significance to the adaptive operation of reservoirs to create reasonable and precise ecological flows for managing fish reproduction, as shown by the promising results in the engineering application to the Three Gorges Reservoir.

Peak catch rates occurred near the confluence of the Illinois and Mississippi rivers. These findings suggest that larval silver carp have an affinity for edge of the flood habitat and further study is needed to better understand how this affects the dynamics of this invasive species in the Mississippi River.

We analyzed fish abundance (catch per unit effort from electrofishing) and water-quality data collected from 1994 to 2013 from three reaches where silver carp populations have been established since 2000, and three reaches where they are not established. Our results provide empirical evidence of a negative effect of invasive silver carp on native sport fish in the UMRS. Although water temperature, suspended solid concentration, and flooding also differed substantially between control and invaded reaches, only silver carp abundance had a direct negative relationship with the abundance of adult sport fish. Our analyses suggest that the mechanism for this decline may be competition for zooplankton between silver carp and larval/juvenile sport fish. In reaches where silver carp is established, recruitment of juvenile sport fish appears to be constrained relative to reaches where silver carp is not established."

These species evolved in Asia, are now invasive in the Mississippi River, and feed voraciously on microparticles including plankton. The food habits and biology of these carps are broadly similar to many filter-feeding fish, none of whose chemical ecology has been examined. We conducted five experiments. First, we demonstrated that buccal-pharngeal pumping (BPP), a behavior in which fish pump water into their buccal cavities, is responsible for sampling food: BPP activity in both silver and bighead carps was low and increased nearly 25-fold after exposure to a filtrate of a planktonic food mixture (P < 0.01) and over 35-fold when planktonic food was added (P < 0.001). Next, we showed that of nine food filtrates, the one containing chemicals released by spirulina, a type of cyanobacterium, was the most potent planktonic component for both species. The potency of filtrates varied between species in ways that reflected their different chemical compositions. While L-amino acids could explain about half of the activity of food filtrate, other unknown chemical stimuli were also implicated. Finally, occlusion experiments showed the olfactory sense has a very important, but not exclusive, role in bigheaded carp feeding behaviors and this might be exploited in both their control and culture."

We hypothesize that both heterochronic and heterotopic changes throughout the evolution of EBOs are at the root of their morphological diversity. Heterochrony is a foundational explanation in developmental studies, however, heterotopy, a developmental change in spatial or topographical relationships, can have even more profound effects on a given structure but has received relatively little attention. Here, we investigate how developmental mechanisms may drive morphological diversity of EBOs within otomorphan fishes. We compare early pharyngeal development in three species, Anchoa mitchilli (Engraulidae) which has the most basic EBO, B. tyrannus (Clupeidae) which has a more complex EBO, and Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Cyprinidae) which has the most complex EBO yet described. Using branchial arch growth rates and morphological analyses, we illustrate how both heterochronic and heterotopic mechanisms are responsible for some of the phenotypic diversity seen in otomorphan EBOs.

This ability drives their efficient consumption of phytoplankton and because they feed low on the food chain they have an important place in aquaculture worldwide. In North America, where they are considered invasive, silver carp deplete food resources for native species and in so doing occupy increased niche space. Here, we determine the ontogenetic stage and size at which silver carp are morphologically capable of primarily feeding on particles <10 mu m. Ecological studies on this species have shown that there is an ontogenetic shift in diet as predominantly zooplanktivorous juveniles later switch to eating much smaller phytoplankton. The occupation of this new trophic niche presents both a metabolic and a mechanical challenge to these fish, since it is unclear how they can efficiently feed on such small particles. We hypothesize that the epibranchial organ (EBO) in silver carp is essential in aggregating these small particles of food, allowing the species to consume mass quantities of tiny particles, thus mitigating metabolic constraints. In this study, we investigate early ontogeny of the EBO in silver carp to determine when this structure achieves the requisite morphology to become functional. We find that at around 80 mm standard length (SL) the EBOs are consistently filled with food, demonstrating that this accumulating organ has become functional. This size corresponds with previous ecological data documenting important shifts in the type of food consumed. While the basic bauplan of the EBO is established very early in ontogeny (by 15 mm SL), multiple waves of histological maturation of muscle, cartilage, gill rakers and epithelium ultimately form the functional structure."

Its complex trophic anatomy may help explain the apparent efficiency with which they consume phytoplankton, outcompeting native filter feeders. This cypriniform species is characterized by trophic synapomorphies that include a palatal organ, loss of upper pharyngeal jaws, and a hypertrophied lower pharyngeal jaw. However, in silver carp these structures have become greatly modified and diverge from the more basal condition that characterizes species such as goldfish. The trophic apparatus of silver carp is composed of discrete structures that are functionally coupled: filtering plates, paired epibranchial organs (EBO), a modified palatal organ composed of large muscular folds that interdigitate with the filtering plates, and hypertrophied lower pharyngeal jaws and teeth. The filtering plates fill a significant portion of the buccal cavity, especially since the distal parts of these filtering plates make up a key component of the EBOs. EBOs, food aggregating structures found in many teleosts, are thought to have independently evolved at least six times. Ranging in complexity from small slits on the dorsal wall of the pharyngeal cavity to exceedingly intricate spiraling structures, EBOs are morphologically diverse among filter-feeding fishes. Despite this morphological diversity and broad taxonomic distribution, little is known regarding the functional anatomy of the EBO. Moreover, the EBO in silver carp is distinct from the organs previously described in other species, being created by four independent pharyngeal involutions (instead of the more typical one or two) that form spiral-shaped pharyngeal tubes surrounded by circumferential muscle. On each side of the head greatly hypertrophied hyomandibulae and opercles are connected to the anterior cartilaginous caps of the bilateral EBOs via enlarged muscles. Given that these fish are pump filter feeders we hypothesize that the opercula may compress and expand the EBOs during pumping causing food to be moved posteriorly toward the pharyngeal jaws."

Filter feeding teleosts typically employ elongated and tightly packed gill rakers with secondary bony or epithelial modifications that increase filtering efficiency. The gill rakers of Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, silver carp, are anatomically distinct from and more complex than the filtering apparatus of other teleostean fishes. The silver carp filtering apparatus is composed of biserial, fused filtering plates used to capture particles ranging in size from 4 to 80 m. Early in ontogeny, at 15-25 mm standard length (SL), silver carp gill rakers are reminiscent of other more stereotypical teleostean rakers, characterized by individual lanceolate rakers that are tightly packed along the entirety of the branchial arches. At 30 mm SL, secondary epithelial projections and concomitant dermal ossification begin to stitch together individual gill rakers. During later juvenile stages, dermal bone further modifies the individual gill rakers and creates a bony scaffold that supports the now fully fused and porous epithelium. By adulthood, the stitching of bone and complete fusion of the overlying epithelium creates rigid filtering plates with morphologically distinct faces. The inner face of the plates is organized into a net-like matrix while the outer face has a sponge-like appearance comprised of differently sized pores. Here, we present morphological data from an ontogenetic series of the filtering apparatus within silver carp. These data inform hypotheses regarding both how these gill raker plates may have evolved from a more basal condition, as well as how this novel architecture allows this species to feed on exceedingly small phytoplankton, particles that represent a greater filtering challenge to the typical anatomy of the gill rakers of fishes."

Silver carp utilize modified gill rakers to capture a specific range of food; however, their greatly modified filtering morphology allows them to feed on phytoplankton and zooplankton ranging in size from 4 to 85 µm. The filtering apparatus of silver carp comprises rigid filtering plates where the outer anatomy of these plates is characterized by long parallel channels that change in orientation along the length of the plate. Here, we investigate the underlying morphology and concomitant hydrodynamics that support the filtration mechanisms of silver and bighead carp. Bighead carp are also invasive filter feeders, but their filtering apparatus is morphologically distinct from that of silver carp. Using 3D particle image velocimetry, we determined how particles and fluid interact with the surface of the gill rakers/plates. Filtering plates in silver carp induce strong directed vortical flow, whereas the filtering apparatus of bighead carp resulted in a type of haphazard cross-flow filtration. The organized vortical flow established by silver carp likely increased the number of interactions that the particle-filled water had with the filtering membrane. This strong vortical organization is maintained only at 0.75 body lengths s<sup>-1</sup>, and vortical flow is poorly developed and maintained at slower and faster speeds. Moreover, we found that absolute vorticity magnitude in silver carp is an order of magnitude greater than in bighead carp."	"10.1242/jeb.183350"	"internal-pdf://0336101194/Cohen-2018.pdf"

Additionally, differences in the behaviour of hybrids may lead to deleterious ecosystem effects that compound any negative impacts of the invading parental species. Invasive silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) provide an opportunity to evaluate how hybridisation may influence the behaviour, dispersal, and spread of an invasive species introgressive complex. In order to investigate the role hybrids may have in the invasion ecology of bigheaded carps, we examined the distribution, movements, and environmental cues for movement of two invasive fishes and their hybrids in the Illinois River (U.S.A.). Early generation hybrids (e.g. F-1,F-2, and first-generation backcross individuals) composed a greater proportion of the population at the invasion front where abundances of bigheaded carp were low. A greater proportion of early hybrids passed through dams upstream towards the invasion front than did other hybrids and parental species. The movements and environmental cues for movement of late-generation backcrosses (more genetically similar to parental genotype) were not different from the parental species with which they shared the most alleles. Although the direction of the relationship between movement and environment was sometimes different for the parental species and associated advanced generation hybrids, these results indicate that management for parental species will also affect most hybrids. Although early generation hybrids are rare, our results indicate they may disperse towards low-density population zones (i.e. invasion fronts) or are produced at greater frequency in low-density areas. These rare hybrids have the potential to produce a variety of unique genetic combinations that could result in more rapid adaptation of a non-native population to their invaded range potentially facilitating the establishment of invasive species."

Acoustic telemetry data were used to parameterize multistate models to examine the spatial dynamics of bigheaded carps in the Illinois River to (1) evaluate the effects of existing dams on movement, (2) identify how individuals distribute among pools, and (3) gauge the effects of reductions in movement towards the invasion front. Multistate models estimated that movement was generally less likely among upper river pools (Starved Rock, Marseilles, and Dresden Island) than the lower river (La Grange and Peoria) which matched the pattern of gated versus wicket style dams. Simulations using estimated movement probabilities indicated that Bighead Carp accumulate in La Grange Pool while Silver Carp accumulate in Alton Pool. Fewer Bighead Carp reached the upper river compared to Silver Carp during simulations. Reducing upstream movement probabilities (e.g., reduced propagule pressure) by75% into any of the upper river pools could reduce upper river abundance with similar results regardless of location.

Invasive Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) have spread throughout much of the Mississippi River Basin, and their presence has resulted in multiple negative ecosystem effects. Silver Carp are known to move hundreds of km, which has likely contributed to their rapid spread. Our study examined movement patterns and environmental cues for movement in Silver Carp based on acoustic telemetry of tagged fish that ranged widely (i.e., mobile) and those that did not range far from the site of their original capture and tagging (i.e., sedentary) in the Wabash River, USA. Sedentary and mobile designations were made based on observed extremes of mean annual ranges, and these designations were consistent within seasons and among years. Both movement groups displayed seasonal variation in movements, with mobile Silver Carp consistently moving greater distances within each season and sedentary Silver Carp exhibiting lower variability in distances moved than mobile individuals. Discharge (change in discharge) and temperature were significant predictors of mobile and sedentary individuals' movements. Additional environmental variables (i.e., cumulative growing degree day, day of year, and change in temperature) also related to movement likelihood of sedentary individuals, whereas total length was the only additional variable that influenced movement likelihood of mobile individuals. Total length was significantly related to movement distance for both groups of Silver Carp, but the relationship was negative for sedentary fish and positive for mobile fish. Results point to differences in behavior that may require targeted management strategies to achieve agency goals to interrupt mobile individual movements that can result in range expansion. Such strategies may also limit introductions and invasions by other aquatic invasive species that exhibit similar behaviors."	"10.1007/s10530-022-02795-6"	"internal-pdf://0624263048/Coulter-2022.pdf"

Swan Lake, a 1100-ha Illinois River (USA) backwater, was rehabilitated to restore ecosystem functions, but may provide valuable habitat for invasive bigheaded carps [bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (H.molitrix)]. Use (residency and passages) of Swan Lake by invasive bigheaded carps was monitored using acoustic telemetry (n=50 individuals/species) to evaluate the use of a large, restored habitat from 2004 to 2005. Passages (entrances/exits) by bigheaded carps were highest in winter, and residency was highest in the summer. Bighead carp backwater use was associated with the differences in temperature between the main channel and backwater, and passages primarily occurred between 18:00h and midnight. Silver carp backwater use was positively correlated with water level and main channel discharge, and fewer passages occurred between 12:00h and 18:00h than during any other time of day. Harvest occurring during summer or high main channel discharge could reduce backwater abundances while maintenance of low water levels could reduce overall backwater use. Conclusions from this study regarding the timing of bigheaded carps' use of backwater habitats are critical to integrated pest management plans to control invasive species.

Diet overlap between invasive Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and native planktivores has been linked to declines in condition and abundance of native planktivores. However, there is little information on how such diet overlap varies temporally. We used stable-isotope ratios to examine seasonal resource overlap among Silver Carp and two native planktivores, Gizzard Shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) and Bigmouth Buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus). Resource overlap between Bigmouth Buffalo and Silver Carp was minimal (<1%) in all seasons, whereas overlap between Gizzard Shad and Silver Carp (7-36%) was larger and varied seasonally. The greatest resource overlap among species occurred in summer, while the smallest overlap occurred in spring. Resource use by Silver Carp appears to be highly specialized in the fall, as indicated by a narrow isotopic niche.Variation in niche size among seasons suggests that Silver Carp may be plastic in their resource use. Overall, the limited resource overlap among invasive and native species revealed in this study suggests potentially low invasive-native competition, although competition may have acted prior to our study to produce shifts in resource use by native fishes."

We used mobile hydroacoustic surveys to examine bigheaded carp population characteristics from 2012 to 2015 across an invasion gradient in the Illinois River (USA), one of the most likely pathways to the Laurentian Great Lakes. These bigheaded carp species comprised 23-46% of fish community abundance and 45-78% of fish biomass across reaches, with lower contribution near the invasion front where intensive management by harvest occurs. Bigheaded carp prevalence in the community did not differ by habitat and comprised > 50% of community abundance and biomass throughout the river for most size classes. We identified negative relationships between density and relative weight (an index of body condition) of bigheaded carp, suggesting evidence of potential density-dependent intraspecific competition. Efforts to reduce invasive species abundances near invasion fronts may reduce prevalence. However, this could inadvertently release individuals from density-dependent competition and could enhance reproductive potential, growth or movements. By employing a suite of control efforts, including continuous removal efforts (including novel approaches) and by limiting movements (e.g., utilizing roads, fences, dams), it may be possible to offset undesired consequences of increased condition."

Recruitment is oftentimes determined by conditions experienced during early life, and winter conditions become increasingly influential as species invade north in temperate regions. Bighead Carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and Silver Carp (H. molitrix) have invaded mid-latitudes of North America and threaten to invade farther north. We conducted pond experiments and bioenergetic simulations to: (1) assess the effects of mild winters on juvenile Bighead Carp and Silver Carp at mid-latitudes; (2) determine how conspecific density affects juveniles during mild winters; and, (3) determine effects of increased winter severity at increasing latitudes. Both species displayed high overwinter survival (85%) in pond experiments. Bighead Carp grew in length (mean 2mm) and maintained initial body mass and percent dry mass (index of energy content). Silver Carp maintained initial length and mass and remained in high condition (dry mass). Conspecific densities tested did not affect growth, condition, or survival. Simulations suggest juvenile Bighead Carp could energetically survive the longest, coldest winter simulated (48 degrees latitude); however, energy reserves at the start of winter became increasingly important for survival as latitude increased. Bighead Carp and Silver Carp recruitment success at mid-latitudes is likely driven by non-winter factors. If these species invade farther north, winter severity may play a stronger role in offspring survival, recruitment, and population dynamics. However, warmer and shorter winters at high latitudes caused by climate change will minimize this potential bottleneck and increase chances of successful recruitment."

Distinct changes in eDNA trends correlated with fish mortality, and results indicate that eDNA sampling could be a useful indicator of piscicide efficacy. This study demonstrates that CO2 administered as dry ice is an effective under-ice piscicide method."

Diatoms, Bacillariophyta, was the main phylum of phytoplankton in Ardalan dam reservoir that was dominant in the most seasons and green algae, Chlorophyta, was the second dominance groups. Survey of zooplanktons showed there were 25 genus from 6 phylum, and Rotatoria constitute 64% of the zooplanktons in. The average phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance during this study were about 19.15×106 and 1863 per liter of lake water respectively. Survey of benthic communities showed that Chironomidae and Tubificidae were the main benthic groups in Ardalan dam. Average of benthic biomass during this survey was 0.9 gr/m2 which is very poor. Sediments in Ardalan dam was mostly of silt and clay. Fish structure survey by gill nets in Ardalan dam showed that common carp and silver carp, by %53 and %45 respectively were the main economical species in the dam. Hydro chemical survey showed that total phosphorus and total nitrogen were 0.073 and 0.779 mg/L respectively. The amount of chlorophyll a was 6.03 mg/m3. The range `of dissolved oxygen was 6.4-10.5 mg/L. Average of EC was 576 µs/cm. Since the water temperature just in august month was more than 20ºC, the appropriate period for warm water fish culture in this reservoir is limited."

Using Sound Metrics software, multiple measurements of each fish (L-T, side aspect angle and distance from the camera) at different times were analysed by two experienced operators while a subset of data was analysed by two inexperienced operators. The main result showed high variability in intra-fish L-T measurements. The number of measurements required to minimise errors and to obtain robust fish measurements (true L-T +/- 3 cm) was estimated by a bootstrap method. Three to five measurements per fish were recommended for fish surveys in rivers. In this experimental study, aiming to reproduce river conditions, no evidence of fish position (side aspect angle and distance from the camera) effect was detected, but an operator effect (partially explained by training) was observed. General linear mixed models also showed that lengths of the smallest fish (L-T < 57 cm) were overestimated and lengths of the largest fish (L-T > 57 cm) were underestimated in comparison with their true lengths.

These gears offer an alternative to sampling in habitats or conditions that are unsuitable for traditional sampling gears, and they may be capable of sampling a different subset of the population. However, little is known about their efficacy as catfish sampling gear. We developed a standardized method for deploying setlines in the form of bank poles and assessed the catch rate, species composition, and efficacy of bank poles in the Kansas River, Kansas. We also used Lindgren-Pitman hook timers to investigate temporal patterns of capture, retention rates, and optimal soak duration. Bank poles (n = 897) were equipped with 6/0 circle hooks baited with Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix cut bait and were deployed overnight during the summers of 2018 and 2019. Bank poles captured a total of seven fish species, with 97% of the species composition being catfishes (n = 258; mean TL = 688 +/- 182.7 mm; range = 392-1,310 mm). Blue Catfish Ictalurus furcatus (45%) was the most commonly captured species, followed by Channel Catfish I. punctatus (37%) and Flathead Catfish Pylodictis olivaris (15%). The success rate for hooking and landing fish with bank poles was 29%. There was no difference between total catch rates from standard bank poles and those from bank poles equipped with hook timers. Higher catch rates were observed early in the set time for Channel and Flathead catfish, whereas a relatively steady catch rate was observed for Blue Catfish. Overall, 46% of catfish were caught within 3 h of gear deployment and 72% were caught within 5 h. We recommend adopting shortened soak durations (about 5 h) to prevent bait loss and to optimize fish retention. Our study provides an alternative sampling approach to increase the catch of large individuals and offers insight into the catch dynamics and interactions of passive angling gears."

Monthly fish price data were collected from the Bangladesh Department of Agricultural Marketing website from January 2007 to December 2019, a period characterized by rapid emergence of aquaculture and declining capture fisheries. Our analysis shows that for almost all the fish species, the direction of market information is moving from the retail market to the wholesale market. This implies that retail markets are more organized and wholesalers follow the price set by the retailers. In the short run, only rohu market shows bidirectional information flow between wholesale and retail markets indicating no single market has significant control over the price. The study has highlighted the role of aquaculture to increase fish production and potential contribution to fish price stabilization and food security."

The total water-spread area of the selected beels varied widely (8-50 ha), with 68.75% of the beels showing a reduction in water-spread area over the past 30 years. High levels of siltation and encroachment and detachment of marginal areas through the construction of roads were the major factors responsible for the reduction in the water-spread area of the beels. The reduction was observed to be in the range of over 33% in three beels (Raghunath Sora, Chulkani, and Dudua beel) to 83% in Bhoishpuri beel. In addition, one beel (Chulkani) experienced reduction in its deep pool area, which is an important wetland area that provides shelter to brood fishes during the dry season. Only 12.5% of the beels studied practiced enclosure (pen) culture for rearing fish. None practiced cage culture. Our study showed that only two beels (Bhoishpuri and Tariachora) were free from exotic fishes; the remaining surveyed beels reported exotic species such as, Cyprinus carpio (Common Carp), Ctenopharyngodon idella (Grass Carp), Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Silver Carp), H. nobilis (Bighead Carp) and Piaractus brachypomus (Pacu). The prevalence of exotic fishes in the majority of the beels (due both to escape from nearby aquaculture ponds during floods and intentional stocking in certain beels) would have adversely affected the diversity of indigenous fishes in those wetlands. From discussion with the fishers, 50% of the beels surveyed experienced a reduction in the number of fish species from that recorded 10-20 years ago. In addition to climate change-related factors (e.g. abnormal rains, floods, or drought-like situations), other factors - both natural (e.g. hyper-nutrification) and anthropogenic (e.g. construction of roads, houses, and other structures) - also adversely affected the studied wetlands. To help cope with these factors and increase the adaptive capacity of fishers, four measures aimed at mitigation are suggested. These are: the practice of enclosure aquaculture in beels; the construction of floating macrophyte refuges (katal); deep pool refuges; and stock enhancement programmes with climate-resilient indigenous fishes."

Hypophthalmichthys molitrix"	"Invasive species can produce complex and unpredictable effects across multiple trophic levels through a combination of direct and indirect pathways. Invasive silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) exert substantial pressure on the link between primary production and intermediate trophic levels in large rivers of the Midwestern USA. The goal of our manuscript was to describe the silver carp population invasion in the Illinois River (Illinois, USA) and explore the potential effects of silver carp on the native biota.We obtained 22 years of data from three long‐term monitoring programmes for phytoplankton, zooplankton, and age‐0 and adult native fishes. To determine when silver carp started affecting native biota, we used nonlinear regression to estimate the change point in silver carp biomass. We then used piecewise linear regression to separately model the response of phytoplankton and age‐0 and adult native fishes, using the model‐estimated change point in silver carp biomass. We tested for differences in taxon‐specific zooplankton density and biomass between pre‐ and post‐establishment periods using generalised linear models. To explore associations between native biota, silver carp and other potential drivers, we used single‐factor linear‐regression models in an information theoretic‐based approach.Our analysis showed individual silver carp condition decreased while their population numbers and biomass increased during their establishment in the Illinois River. Concurrently, analysis of 22 years of producer and consumer abundance and biomass data shows phytoplankton density and macrozooplankton density and biomass decreased—zooplankton by over 90%—during the same period, though the responses of age‐0 native fish biomass and adult native fish biomass were more nuanced.Our study provides compelling evidence of multiple trophic‐level effects from the silver carp invasion in North America and highlights the importance of long‐term data collection and monitoring. Our research shows managers that zooplankton and perhaps phytoplankton are quickly and negatively affected by silver carp, which may eventually cascade into higher trophic levels over longer timescales."

Fish suffer death from gas bubble disease (GBD) caused by TDG supersaturation. Nonetheless, current studies mainly attach importance to the survival of benthic fish affected by TDG supersaturation in the Yangtze River in China. Few studies have attempted to investigate the survival of pelagic fish influenced by TDG supersaturated water and compare the tolerance characteristics to TDG supersaturation between benthic and pelagic fish. To identify the survival of fish species that inhabit the various water layers affected by TDG supersaturation, silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) (pelagic fish) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) (benthic fish) were chosen to conduct an acute exposure experiment of four different TDG supersaturation levels (125%, 130%, 135% and 140%). The findings illustrated that the two fish species both exhibited evident aberrant behaviours of maladjustment in TDG supersaturated water. Obvious GBD symptoms were also found in the test fish. The survival probability of silver carp and common carp decreased with increasing levels of TDG supersaturation. The median survival time (ST50) values of the silver carp exposed to four levels of TDG supersaturated water (125%, 130%, 135% and 140%) were 26.84, 7.96, 5.56 and 3.62 h, respectively, whereas the ST50 values of common carp were 53.50, 26.00, 16.50 and 11.70 h, respectively. When compared with common carp, silver carp had a weaker tolerance to TDG-supersaturated water and were vulnerable to GBD. It shows that levels above 125% are not safe for common carp survival. In terms of the tolerance threshold value, silver carp merits further investigation because it showed lower tolerance to TDG than did common carp."

A proper SP amount could significantly(p < 0.05) improve the breaking force, deformation, hardness, springiness and whiteness of surimi gels, 6% PHCSP addition showing the best performance in improving the surimi gel strength. Stress relaxation results indicated that SP addition could increase equilibrium stress, the equilibrium elastic coefficient (E1) and decay elastic coefficient (E2), indicating an increased hardness and elasticity. Rheological tests revealed significantly higher G ' values for surimi/SP composite gels than pure surimi gel, indicating the high elasticity of composite gels. The relaxation time T2 indicated that free water was converted into immobile water or even bound water when SP added into surimi. Additionally, surimi/6% PHCSP gels were found to retain more water due to chitosan precipitated along with the SP. The lightness and whiteness values of surimi gels were enhanced in surimi gels added with a proper SP amount. However, excessive SP had a dilution effect on fish myofibrillar protein (MP) that dominates gel formation, resulting in weak surimi gels. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that surimi/6% PHCSP gels could form a dense and homogeneous network with a pore density of 24.74 +/- 0.08/mu m2. Overall, SP could endow the sliver carp surimi with a satisfactory gelation ability because SP had the self-gelation ability or had an interaction with MP."

These species vary seasonally in distribution and abundance due to environmental conditions such as precipitation and temperature. Monitoring this seasonal movement is important for management to control the population size and spread of the species. We examined if environmental DNA (eDNA) approaches could detect seasonal changes of these species. To do this, we developed a novel genetic marker that was able to both detect and differentiate bighead and silver carp DNA. We used the marker, combined with a novel occupancy model, to study the occurrence of bigheaded carps at 3 sites on the Wabash River over the course of a year. We studied the Wabash River because of concerns that carps may be able to use the system to invade the Great Lakes via a now closed (ca. 2017) connection at Eagle Marsh between the Wabash River's watershed and the Great Lakes' watershed. We found seasonal trends in the probability of detection and occupancy that varied across sites. These findings demonstrate that eDNA methods can detect seasonal changes in bigheaded carps densities and suggest that the amount of eDNA present changes seasonally. The site that was farthest upstream and had the lowest carp densities exhibited the strongest seasonal trends for both detection probabilities and sample occupancy probabilities. Furthermore, other observations suggest that carps seasonally leave this site, and we were able to detect this with our eDNA approach.

As the cultured juveniles are released into self-recruiting wild population to increase fisheries resources yields, they may potentially come along with negative impacts such as intra-inter specific completion, loss of genetic diversity and fitness, even causing genetic risk. To assess the relationship between genetic risk and stock enhancement (SE) of the silver carp in the Yangtze River (YR); microsatellite loci amplification, parentage assignment, genetic diversity, genetic differentiation and structure were conducted and testified by the help of eleven fluorescence labeled microsatellite markers method. Results showed that silver carp populations in the YR had relatively higher genetic diversity (UHe), inbreeding coefficient (Fis), and effective population size (Ne) than breeding stock populations from eight hatcheries. By using the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), results showed that the percentage of variance among populations and within populations were 4.15 % and 95.85 %, respectively, which indicated that genetic structure of YR populations possibly had been changed by SE. Therefore, the present study suggests that the large-scale SE possibly resulted in negative genetic impact on silver carp population.

Because of climate fluctuation, human activities, and water conservancy projects, it has been reported that natural fish resources of the silver carp have been declining in a wavy trend from 1950. However, few studies have explored the potential effects of determining the relationship between the adult fish and fish larvae. Using the field survey method, this study analyzed the fisheries resource status of the adult silver carp and its early life stage in the Yangtze River. Results indicated that different geographic populations showed significant habitat dependence, and the adult silver carp tends to choose habitats with slow water flow, rich biological bait, and less human interference. What is more, its distribution pattern has regional and seasonal differences obviously. Additionally, redundancy analysis on the fish larvae showed that water temperature and water flow are the two most important factors influencing the fish larvae blooming. According to the generalized additive model (GAM), the hydrological factors that significantly influence the larvae abundance are water temperature, transparency, daily increasing rate of water level, and discharge (p < 0.05). Combining the historical and present research data, the results indicated that river and lake connected habitat is essential for the silver carp recruitment and migration. Future studies should focus on the complementary mechanism of silver carp both in the natural habitat and invasion waters. It is suggested that the spawning habitat should be well protected during the channel project and economic belt construction along the Yangtze River."

The panels were verified using population genetic analyses, and species and simulated hybrid discriminations based on the genotype data of all individuals from two populations for each species. The number of alleles (Na), the observed and expected heterozygosity (Ho and He), and the polymorphic information content (PIC) of twelve loci were ranged from 5 to 20, 0.189 to 0.956, 0.177 to 901, and 0.169 to 0.887, respectively. Overall, almost all the microsatellite loci were detected as highly polymorphic across the two species. The populations of same species showed close genetic distances and similar genetic structures. Significant genetic differentiations were only detected between populations from different species, with a higher variation between species (21.17%) compared with that between populations within species (0.18%). In the species and simulated hybrid discrimination analyses, the individuals from different species were separated distinctly, and the simulated hybrids could almost be separated with the true individuals.

The amounts of peptides and amino acids reached their maximum at the end of digestion and showed slight difference to the control gels.

Here, we used nuclear microsatellites to analyze genetic diversity and structure and whole mitogenomic sequences to analyze the phylogeography of Silver Carp (SC; Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and Bighead Carp (BHC; H. nobilis) across their North American ranges. Our objectives were to assess: (1) the number of mitochondrial haplotypes that were introduced and how they are distributed in North America, which may provide insight into the history of the invasion, (2) how genetic diversity compares between the native Asian and introduced North American populations, (3) how genetic variation is structured across the North American ranges of SC and BHC as well as between the two species, and (4) whether patterns of genetic diversity and structure are likely to affect success of environmental DNA programs for monitoring these species. In both species, we found relatively few mitochondrial haplotypes, and most were present throughout the range. For both SC and BHC, unique haplotypes were found only in a portion of the species’ range, possibly indicating the location of additional, more recent introductions. In both species, genetic diversity was moderately lower in North American populations (i.e., 75–90% of that found in Asian populations), but genetic diversity still remained high. We found very little population genetic structure, consistent with a rapidly spreading invasive species, and did not find evidence of cryptic interspecific hybrids. The markers developed for eDNA monitoring will be effective for detecting the majority of individuals of these species in North America. The relatively high level of genetic variation and lack of population structure of SC and BHC in North America indicate that genetic diversity likely will not limit their persistence and that high connectivity will likely complicate efforts to control these invasive species."

However, studies about sex determination in this large family is still rear, and one of the reasons is lack of high quality and complete genome. Here, we used nanopore to sequence the genome of a male bighead carp, obtaining contig N50 = 24.25 Mb, which is one of the best assemblies in Cyprinidae. Five males and five females were re-sequenced, and a male-specific region on LG19 was confirmed. We find this region holds many male-specific markers in other Cyprinidae fishes, such as grass carp and silver carp. Transcriptome analyses of hypothalamus and pituitary tissues showed that several sex-specific differentially expressed genes were associated with steroid biosynthesis. The UCH64E gene, located in the male-specific region on LG19, showed higher expression levels in male than female tissues of bighead carp. The methyl-RAD of hypothalamus tissues between males and females indicated that the sexual methylation differences are significant in bighead carp. We also compared the methylation sites recognized using methyl-RAD and nanopore raw reads and found that approximately 73% of the methylation sites identified using methyl-RAD were within nanopore CpG sites."

There is no available ecological information about this parasitic infection in wild host fish. The present work aimed to investigate the infection rate and distribution of C. schistorchis in wild silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrbc, and to assess the influence of environmental factors on infection by the parasite. From October 2016 to May 2019, a total of 554 wild silver carp were collected from two reservoirs. These collected fish were weighed, measured, and dissected to observe the presence of C. schistorchis following standard methodology. Ecological analysis results showed that the frequency distribution of C. schistorchis in the host population was aggregated distribution. The abundance of C. schistorchis exhibited a positive correlation with the host age and condition factor of silver carp, but it showed no relationship with water temperature, pH or DO. The condition factor value of infected fish was significantly higher than that of uninfected fish. These results indicated that food intake, not environmental factors, directly determined infection by the parasite in the host, indicating that an increased food intake would increase the risk of infection. Thus, the number of parasites could be used as an indirect biological marker for assessing the effectiveness of silver carp in filter-feeding on plankton. The following analysis indicated that silver carp with a body length of 50-55 cm showed the highest efficiency in controlling phytoplankton biomass. This study provides important information for understanding the ecology of C. schistorchis in wild silver carp."	"10.1016/j.ijppaw.2020.08.005"	"internal-pdf://2999052326/Fu-2020.pdf"

However, the use of filter-feeding aquatic animals to control eutrophic water bodies remains debatable. As such, more work is needed to understand the combined effects of submerged macrophytes and aquatic animals on the restoration of eutrophic water bodies. In this study, we first conducted a mesocosm experiment to evaluate the combined effects of submerged macrophytes and aquatic animals on water body restoration, and then applied these results in the field. We found that silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) deteriorated water quality by increasing nutrient and total suspended solid concentrations, and decreased the biomass of submerged macrophytes. However, triangle sail mussels (Hyriopsis cumingii) promoted the establishment of a clear-water state by grazing on phytoplankton and detritus, and stimulating submerged macrophyte growth. In practical ecological engineering, we suggest that silver carp can be used at low density (20 g/m(3)) as a biomanipulation tool, despite their potential to deteriorate water quality. Furthermore, stocking mussels in nets at a biomass of 150 g/m3 can be effectively used to restore eutrophicated water bodies. Finally, Hydrilla verticillata and Potamogeton malaianus, in combination with filter-feeding aquatic animals, are suitable submerged macrophyte species for the restoration of eutrophicated lakes.

The gelation properties of samples were evaluated by puncture properties, microstructures, water-holding capacity, dynamic rheological properties and intermolecular interactions. As the salt content increased from 0 to 5%, gel properties of surimi without HIU significantly improved. For samples with low-salt (0-2% NaCl) content, HIU induced obvious enhancement in breaking force and deformation. HIU promoted the protein aggregation linked by SeS bonds, hydrophobic interactions and non-disulfide covalent bonds in surimi gels with low-salt content. Moreover, microstructures of HIU surimi gels with low-salt content were more compact than those of the corresponding control samples. HIU also improved the gelation properties of surimi with 3% NaCl to an extent. However, for high-salt (4-5% NaCl) samples, HIU decreased the breaking force and deformation of surimi gels due to the degradation of proteins suggested by increased TCA-soluble peptides. In conclusion, HIU effectively improved the gelation properties of surimi with low-salt content (0-2% NaCl), but was harmful for high-salt (4-5% NaCl) surimi.

The eggs, which are believed to perish if they settle before hatching, are slightly denser than water and are held in suspension by water turbulence. It is possible to use egg drift modeling to assess the capability of a river to support the survival of Asian carp eggs. Detection of spawning and estimation of egg abundance in the drift are typically assessed by ichthyoplankton trawls. Correct sampling design and interpretation of trawl data require knowledge of the vertical distribution of eggs in the drift, which can be accomplished with particle transport models. Data that are required to populate models of egg drift and vertical distribution include physical properties of assessed rivers and information on egg size, density, and terminal fall velocity, but data on these egg characteristics have not been previously available. Physical characteristics of the eggs are presented as a function of postfertilization time. We recorded mean egg diameter and terminal fall velocity for eggs from each Asian carp species during the first 5 h of development and at approximately 12 and 22 h postfertilization. Eggs of all species reached their maximum size before 4 h. Water-hardened eggs of Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Grass Carp Ctenopharyngodon idella were similarly sized in our trials, and water-hardened eggs of Bighead Carp H. nobilis were the largest. After water hardening, Silver Carp eggs sank slowest, and Bighead Carp eggs sank fastest. For a given species, smaller-diameter eggs generally had faster terminal fall velocities and higher specific gravity than larger eggs. We provide regression models of egg density and diameter for all three species, discuss usage of these data in modeling the drift and dispersion of Asian carp eggs, and discuss implications for egg sampling design."

Questions about recruitment potential motivate a need for accurate models of egg and larval dispersal. Quantitative data on swimming behaviors and capabilities during early ontogeny are needed to improve these dispersal models. We measured ontogenetic changes in routine and maximum swimming speeds of bighead, grass, and silver carp larvae. Daily measurements of routine swimming speed were taken for two weeks post-hatch using a still camera and the LARVEL program, a custom image-analysis software. Larval swimming speed was calculated using larval locations in subsequent image frames and time between images. Using an endurance chamber, we determined the maximum swimming speed of larvae (post-gas bladder inflation) for four to eight weeks post-hatch. For all species, larval swimming speeds showed similar trends with respect to ontogeny: increases in maximum speed, and decreases in routine speed. Maximum speeds of bighead and grass carp larvae were similar and generally faster than silver carp larvae. Routine swimming speeds of all larvae were highest before gas bladder inflation, most likely because gas bladder inflation allowed the fish to maintain position without swimming. Downward vertical velocities of pre-gas bladder inflation fish were faster than upward velocities. Among the three species, grass carp larvae had the highest swimming speeds in the pre-gas bladder inflation period, and the lowest speeds in the post-gas bladder inflation period. Knowledge of swimming capability of these species, along with hydraulic characteristics of a river, enables further refinement of models of embryonic and larval drift."

In two experiments, PIT-tagged carp were stocked into ponds (N = 3 for silver carp; N = 1 for common carp) while one of two stimuli (planktonic food [spirulina] for silver carp and a sex pheromone [prostaglandin F2α] for male common carp) was added to determine if we could attract fish to one side while measuring both fish presence (detections) and eDNA concentrations. The addition of spirulina increased detections of silver carp by 2–3 fold, while eDNA concentrations increased by 4-fold on the test side when compared to the side without the stimulus. The addition of the sex pheromone increased detections of common carp by ~25-fold, where a 6-fold increase in eDNA concentrations was measured (p < 0.05).

In the Illinois River, an important tributary of the Upper Mississippi River, reproduction appears to be sporadic and frequently unsuccessful, yet bigheaded carp densities in this river are among the highest recorded on the continent. Understanding the causative factors behind erratic recruitment in this commercially-harvested invasive species is important for both limiting their spread and managing their harvest. We analyzed weekly catch records from 15 years of a standardized monitoring program to document the emergence of age-0 bigheaded carp in relation to environmental conditions. The appearance of age-0 fish was generally linked to hydrographic attributes, which probably serve as a cue for spawning. However, we found profound differences in the number of age-0 fish among years, which varied by as much as five orders of magnitude in successive years. The strong link between summer flooding and age-0 fish production we observed emphasizes the importance of understanding the hydrologic context in which sustained invasions occur. Despite evidence of sporadic recruitment, bigheaded carp populations in the Illinois River appear to be consistent or increasing because of particularly strong, episodic year classes."

Monitoring their reproduction can help to determine establishment in new areas but is difficult due to challenges associated with identifying fish eggs. Recently, random forest models provided accurate identification of eggs based on morphological traits, but the models have not been validated using independent data. Our objective was to evaluate the predictive performance of egg identification models developed by Camacho et al. (2019) for classifying invasive carp eggs by using an independent data set. When invasive carp were grouped as one category, predictive accuracy was high at the following levels: family (89%), genus (90%), species (91%), and species with reduced predictor variables (94%). Invasive carp predictive accuracy decreased when we only considered observations from newly sampled locations (family: 9%; genus: 22%; species: 30%; species with reduced predictor variables: 70%), suggesting potential differences in egg characteristics among locations. Random forest models using a combination of previous and new data resulted in high predictive accuracy for invasive carp (96-98%) when invasive carp were grouped as one class for all models at the family, genus, and species levels. The two most influential predictor variables were average membrane diameter and average embryo diameter; the probability of predicting an invasive carp egg increased with these metrics. High predictive accuracy metrics suggest that these trained and validated random forest models can be used to identify invasive carp eggs based on morphometric variables. However, decreased performance at new locations suggests that more research would be beneficial to determine the models' applicability to a larger spatial region."

Bone tissue from phytophagous carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) was used to obtain bioactive peptides through papain-assisted hydrolysis. The peptides with molecular weight lower than 3 kDa were characterized through MALDI-ToF/ToF mass spectrometry and bioinformatics tools. As a prerequisite for microencapsulation, the ability of these peptides to bind the flavonoids extracted from yellow onion skins was further tested through fluorescence quenching measurements. The results obtained demonstrate a considerable binding potency with a binding value of 106 and also the presence of one single or one class of binding site during the interaction process of flavonoids with peptides, in which the main forces involved are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. In the freeze-drying microencapsulation process, an efficiency for total flavonoids of 88.68 ± 2.37% was obtained, considering the total flavonoids and total polyphenols from the powder of 75.72 ± 2.58 quercetin equivalents/g dry weight (DW) and 97.32 ± 2.80 gallic acid equivalents/g DW, respectively.

In this study, the toxic effects of fresh algae solution (FAS) and rotten algae solution (RAS) were investigated. The results showed that the composition of RAS was predominantly organic acids, ketones, polypeptides, esters, phenols, amino acids and intermediate metabolic products. The safety concentrations (SCs) of FAS to Carassius auratus, Ctenopharyngodon idellus and Hypophthalmichthys molitrix were 1.92 x 10(10) cells/L, 1.58 x 10(11) cells/L and 1.30 x 10(11) cells/L, respectively. The SCs of the RAS were significantly lower than those of the FAS (p < 0.05), with the values of 1.25 x 10(9) cells/L, 8.8 x 10(9) cells/L and 9.7 x 10(9) cells/L, for each species, respectively. The toxic algae solutions caused congestion inside the gills, intestinal lesions and high infection rates in the tested fish. FAS and RAS exposure also activated the antioxidant defense system and changed the intestinal microbial structure, resulting in the damage to the microbial balance in the body, and eventually the death of the fish. By studying the acute toxicity to fish, the harm of HABs to aquatic organisms can be predicted."

The trends of storage modulus, tan , and interactions demonstrated a negative effect of rice residue (more than 1%) on gel network. The addition of rice residue reduced the interactions in surimi gel network, such as hydrophobic interaction. The sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that there was little interaction between rice proteins and myofibrillar proteins. Rice residue deteriorated the freeze-thaw stability of surimi gels. Therefore, rice residue could be an inactive filler in the gel network unless it was less than 1%."

The mixture composed of 50% (w/w) chicken meat and 50% (w/w) silver carp meat, and the three paste gels, were assessed based on color, gel strength, TPA, water distribution, chemical interactions, and SDS-PAGE. Chicken gels had better gel properties and a higher content of immobilized water than the mixture or fish gels, regardless of setting conditions.

Piscivorous birds can also contribute the DNA of prey species to a water body. Here, we develop and apply a loading model to estimate the number of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) DNA target marker copies that are potentially deposited by nesting double crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) in the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS). The model assumes a conservative breeding population estimate ranging between 6000 and 8000 cormorants distributed among three large colonies in the Chicago metropolitan area. The model also assumes that cormorants are distributing feces randomly throughout the CAWS in proportion to the amount of time spent at each location. Results show that cormorants may be contributing 2.6 to 113 target marker copies/m(2)/day if birds are spending 22% of their time on open water and 6.4 to 291 target marker copies/m2/day if birds are spending 56% of their time on open water. Over the entire CAWS, cormorants may contribute tens of millions to billions of silver carp DNA copies each day. These target marker loads may be contributing to positive detections of silver carp environmental DNA (eDNA) in the CAWS.

Microwave processing technologies such as microwave drying, heating and sterilizing play a significant role in food quality and safety control. However, few reviews have been published in recent years summarizing the latest developments in the application of microwave technology in the food industry. Scope and approach: This review focuses on recent applications of microwave processing technologies including microwave drying, heating, and sterilizing in fruit (banana, apple, olive, sour cherries, pomegranate arils, blueberries, kiwifruit, aronia, strawberry, and grape tomato), vegetables (potato, bamboo shoot, purslane leaves, onion, green bean, pumpkin, eggplant, edamame, sea tangle, garlic, kale, red cabbage, tomato, cassava, lentils, chickpea, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, jalapefio peppers, and coriander foliage), and meat products (sardine fish, restructured silver carp slices, sea cucumber, beef semitendinosus muscle, bovine supraspinatus muscle, camel longissimus dorsi muscle, foal meat, bovine gluteus medium muscle, chicken steak, mature cows semimembranosus and semitendinosus muscles, kavurma (a ready-to-eat meat product), salmon, cod, drumettes, and beef slices), changes in product quality as affected with microwave processing are discussed in details, and future directions of research are presented. Key findings and conclusions: Microwave drying has the advantages of low energy consumption and high efficiency as compared to conventional drying, while producing more porous structure of foods. Microwave drying usually combines with other conventional drying to enhance the quality of a food product. Compared with the traditional method, microwave heating or cooking can generally retain higher levels of bioactive components, antioxidant activity and attractive color of vegetables, while microwave cooking with water can cause a serious drop in nutrients due to leaching and thermal liability. Microwave sterilization has the capacity to completely inactivate microorganisms and effectively destroy enzyme activity, and less effect on antioxidant activity, texture and color of food products compared with conventional pasteurization.

The flow regime alternation of rivers has an impact on the spawning and reproduction conditions of four major Chinese carps in the lower reaches of the Three Gorges Reservoir. To investigate the changes in hydrological conditions and spawning and reproduction performances of four major Chinese carps during their spawning period before and after impoundment of Three Gorges Reservoir, a quantitative analysis of the relevance between such hydrological parameters as flow, water level, sediment concentration and water temperature of Yichang Station and larva runoff of the four species during their spawning period was carried out. As suggested by the results, when four major Chinese carps are spawning, the proper hydrological parameters would be 11,000-15,000 m(3)/s for flow, 43.0-46.0 m for water level, 0.01-0.21 kg/m(3) for sediment concentration and 4-8 d for water rise, and 22-24 degrees C for water temperature. Among those values, water rise and sediment concentration appear to be in significant positive correlation with the larvae abundance of four major Chinese carps, and thus remain critical factors. After the impoundment of Three Gorges Reservoir, the declining trend in flow, water level and water temperature during the spawning period of four major Chinese carps is not significant when compared with that in sediment concentration (by over 98%). The spawning and reproduction time of four species also gets retarded due to the late-coming proper water temperature, so does the spawning scale. The proportions of four carps also change a lot, with silver carp ascending to be at the highest ratio among them. This study can provide a reference for the protection of important fishes in the lower reaches of Three Gorges Reservoir."

So the present study was designed to determine the hematological parameters of farm and river Chenab (wild) selected fish species including (Labeo rohita, Cirrhinus mrigala, Cyprinus carpio, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Ctenopharyngodon idella). Fish species selected for the current study is generally widely cultured in Pakistan and worldwide. Fish sampling was done by using different nets (river and farm) and blood sampling was immediately drawn from caudal peduncle by syringe and added in EDTA containing vial and shake well for proper mixing. Vials stored in ice containing boxes and carried to laboratory for total complete blood count. The water parameter was analyzed in laboratory by taking the sample of water and some (Temperature, DO) was measured in situ. Results of hematological analysis revealed that there is no significant (P 0.05) difference in packed cell volume, mean cell volume and mean cell hemoglobin of different selected species adapted to similar environmental conditions. However, all other parameters like red blood cells, hemoglobin, mean cell hemoglobin concentration, white blood cells, lymphocytes, mid-range cells, granulocytes and other less important parameters including platelets, red cell distribution width-standard deviation, red cell distribution width-coefficient of variation, platelet distribution width, mean platelet volume, Plateletcrit and Platelet-Large cell ratio are differed significantly (P<0.05). Similar trend was observed in fishes of both selected sites "Farm" and "River. It was concluded that hematological variance can occur between animals of different species and same species of different habitat, but as the water parameter remains the same across the studies so current studies don't show any significant difference."

In total, 544 candidate founders were sampled, of which 220 from 17 hatcheries were ultimately spawned as the 'actual founders' of the WorldFish Silver Carp Genetic Improvement Program (WSCGIP) population. The extent of relatedness among candidate founders was unknown when they were sourced from hatcheries. Candidate founders were genotyped using the DArTseq platform - with a total of 15,102 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 13,504 silicoDArT markers obtained - and genetic affinities among hatcheries examined. Based on unsupervised k-means clustering and hatchery-identified origins, each hatchery was assigned to one of six genetic groups to enable the adoption of genetic group models in pedigree-based analyses. Within genetic groups, sibship was assigned using COLONY software, and a pedigree constructed and validated against genomic relationships generated from 2007 SNPs retained after quality control. The mean pedigree-derived additive genetic relationship between actual founders was small (0.0093), indicating that relationships between actual founders are unlikely to have a meaningful impact on future parent selection, mating decisions or rates of inbreeding."

We compared Silver Carp catch rates, sample run time, and Silver Carp length frequency distributions from the electrified dozer trawl with those from conventional boat electrofishing. Silver Carp capture was greater and sample time was shorter for the electrified dozer trawl compared to conventional boat electrofishing. Length frequency distributions were similar between gears.

Of particular concern are invasive planktivorous fishes (e.g., silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and bighead carp H. nobilis, collectively known as bigheaded carps) that have the potential to modify basal food web structure and compete for planktonic resources with native planktivores and young-of-year fishes. Bigheaded carps have proliferated throughout the Mississippi River basin, creating an outsized potential for resource competition with native fishes. Studies have showed niche overlap between bigheaded carps and native planktivores is generally high but that overlap varies among rivers. Importantly, niche overlap has not been assessed for density extremes of bigheaded carps within a river to determine whether trophic niches changed as a result of the invasion. The objectives of this study were to determine whether (1) silver and/or bighead carps share a similar isotopic niche with four native planktivores, and (2) that association varies ecologically (i.e., low- and high-densities of bigheaded carps) and spatially (i.e., between rivers). Our results generally show high trophic overlap among species, suggesting potential direct resource competition. Niche overlap was higher in study reaches with low densities of bigheaded carps compared to reaches with high densities, presumably due to intense resource competition and limiting of resources under high densities of bigheaded carps. Across density extremes, trophic reorganization by bigmouth buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus) was divergent from other native planktivores. Species-specific responses may be due to subtle differences in feeding strategies, degree of planktivory, food selectivity, and correlated food size distributions."

Although silver carp, Hypophthalmicthys molitrix, is an important aquaculture species in South Asia, information on sperm biology and storage is limited. The study aims to test the efficacy of NaCl solutions for activation and short-term storage of silver carp sperm. We found that the motility of silver carp sperm lasted for 45 sec after activation in distilled water. Sperm motility was higher within the first 10 sec of sperm activation, but sperm movement decreased with increasing activation time. When sperm was suspended a graded dilution of NaCl solutions (17 mM to 188 mM), sperm was immobilized at 154mM NaCl (287 mOsmol kg–1). The efficacy of sperm immobilizing solutions was validated during short-term storage at 4°C. A total of 7.1 ± 3.1% sperm was motile in 154 mM NaCl after 5 days of storage. Sperm motility lasted up to 2 days when sperm diluted in 103, 120, 171 and 188 mM NaCl solutions. The osmotic balance between seminal plasma and NaCl solution prepared at 154 mM prevented sperm activation and provided a suitable media for short-term storage. A 154 mM NaCl solution can be used for sperm collection and short-term storage of silver carp sperm."	"10.22034/iar.2021.1921416.1130"	"internal-pdf://3410291897/sVz6M"

Iran"	"The intestines of most animals contain bacterial species called lactobacilli. Lactobacillus plantarum is a microorganism that settles in the intestinal environment and inhibits the activities of useless microorganisms and pathogens (Andanil et al., 2012). Lactic acid bacteria are the most important probiotic microorganisms including various bacteria such as lactobacilli and Bifidobacterium (Marco et al. 2006). Lactobacilli are gram-positive, non-motile, spore-less and catalase negative bacilli that convert different sugars into lactate and acetate (Guy et al., 2014). L. casei and L. plantarum also have good antagonistic impacts on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (Salehi, 2013). Probiotics can stabilize microbial balance in the intestinal environment by improving their health and usefulness. In addition, probiotics play an important role in maintaining the consumers' health through the synthesis of some essential nutrients (Behnsen et al., 2009; Mohammadian et al., 2014). The bacterium was identified by a molecular technique using a primer designed from the 16S rRNA gene to perform PCR reaction for the detection of Lactobacillus genera (Nour, 1998). The intestines from 50 fish specimens were sampled, among which 28 positive samples of L. plantarum were identified and isolated after staining and testing by PCR (Lotfi et al. 2010)."

Clinical signs observed in moribund animals included erratic swimming behavior, such as spiraling and spinning at the surface. A moribund specimen was captured by dip net near the surface at Lake Providence Landing in East Carroll Parish, northern Louisiana, and was submitted for analysis. An aseptic necropsy was performed, and diagnostic procedures, including bacteriology, parasitology, histopathology, virology, and electron microscopy, revealed that a gram-positive coccus was the primary pathogen. Pure cultures of the organism were obtained from the brain, and it was the predominant colony type isolated from the spleen, kidney, and liver. Bacterial sepsis caused by the gram-positive coccus and involving multiple organ systems was diagnosed histologically. Bacterial colonization and necrotic lesions were seen in the spleen, liver, kidney, heart, eye, and brain. Numerous cocci were observed dividing intracellularly in phagocytic cells of the kidney and brain by transmission electron microscopy. The organism was identified as Streptococcus dysgalactiae ssp. dysgalactiae by conventional biochemical methods and subsequently by the API 20 Strep system. The identity of the pathogen was later confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Multilocus sequence analysis clustered this isolate along with two other S. dysgalactiae isolates from fish in a divergent phyletic group that was separate from other S. dysgalactiae ssp. dysgalactiae isolates from terrestrial animals, implying a possible novel clade that is pathogenic for fish."

Fertile diploid Grass Carp are used legally for vegetation control in Missouri; however, it is uncertain whether Grass Carp in Truman Reservoir are the result of natural reproduction or escapees. We used ichthyoplankton tows and environmental DNA (eDNA) to investigate which carp species were present in the reservoir basin and if these carps were spawning in reservoir tributaries. Grass Carp eggs were collected in four of five tributaries during June 2014; Neither eggs, larvae, or eDNA of Bighead Carp or Silver Carp were detected. The occurrence of Grass Carp eggs generally coincided with rapid increases in discharge and turbidity. These tributaries may be the smallest rivers worldwide in which spawning of Grass Carp has been documented. We infer from the developmental stages captured and the distance from the reservoir that sufficient river length exists for egg survival. These results have broad implications concerning establishment of Grass Carp in other novel habitats including other reservoirs and lake basins, smaller rivers and the Laurentian Great Lakes ecosystem."

Compared with the traditional water bath heating, ultrasonic-assisted treatments significantly improved the gelation properties of surimi at the same salt level. In fact, ultrasound treatment also facilitated the unfolding of alpha-helix structure of the protein, with the resulting exposure of internal groups further enhancing hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds between protein molecules, thereby leading to the formation of denser microstructures with smaller holes. Furthermore, the most noteworthy ultrasonic treatment group was ultrasoundassisted preheating (U + W) group, whose gelation performance under low salt condition, was comparable with that of the traditional two-stage heating (W + W) group with high salt content.

Fish were first exposed to 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 mL L-1 2-PE, and the time of induction (deep anesthesia) and recovery were measured. At concentrations of 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 mL L-1 2-PE, all fish were anaesthetized within 3 min of exposure. For assessing possible stress effects caused by effective concentrations of 2-PE, the haematological indices, serum cortisol and glucose were determined in the deeply anaesthetized fish as stress indicators. 2-PE exposure resulted in a significant increase in red blood cell (RBC) amounts at 0.1 and 0.3 mL L-1. A parallel increase in hemoglobin and Haematocrite amounts at 0.1 concentrations (p<0.05) was observed. The serum cortisol levels had the highest amount in 0.1 mL L-1 of 2-PE. Moreover 2-PE exposure resulted in a significant increase in glucose amounts first at the 0.1 and later in the 0.3 mL L-1 concentrations. This study shows that rapid induction of deep anesthesia with a relatively high concentration of 2-PE (0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 mL L-1) was associated with the lowest effects on the haematological and serum biochemical indices in silver carp and so 0.7 mL L-1 could be suggested as a suitable dose for haematological studies in this species."

Preliminary assessments of spawning potential of Great Lakes tributaries are needed to effectively allocate resources to early-detection programs and more detailed hydrodynamic modelling. Previous preliminary assessments determining the Asian carp spawning potential of tributaries potentially masked temporal variations in stream temperature and velocity. A preliminary assessment was developed that incorporates both the spawning biology of Asian carps and the hydrodynamics of tributaries, based on data at a higher temporal resolution than used previously, to determine the spawning potential of a tributary. The assessment was conducted on eight Lake Ontario tributaries, based on in-situ temperature and velocity data from 2009 to 2014. Two tributaries were found to be suitable using mean data across the assessed time frame; however, inter-annual suitability varied greatly and six tributaries were found to be suitable in at least one of six years over the study period. The assessment highlights previously unexplored inter-annual variation in suitability and provides a method using existing data to identify suitable tributaries for more detailed analyses involving hydrodynamic modelling. This approach can be used as a heuristic first step to inform management actions, such as early-detection and rapid-response programs, to prevent Asian carp spawning in the Canadian Great Lakes basin."

Hydrodynamic modelling can determine if successful hatching of carp eggs can occur in a tributary, by predicting egg movement during a spawning event to see if hatching can occur before eggs settle. A 3-D hydrodynamic model, coupled with a Lagrangian particle tracker, was used to assess hatching rates of three Asian carp species (bighead, grass, and silver carps) in different temperature and flow scenarios in the east Don River, a potential spawning tributary to Lake Ontario. In-river hatching rates were highest in scenarios with warmer summer water temperatures (23-25 degrees C) and flow magnitudes of 15-35 m(3)/s, which occur at least once every year. Using a 3-D hydrodynamic model allowed the inclusion of low-velocity zones where eggs become trapped in lower flow scenarios, thereby reducing modelled hatching success. In-river hatching rates were significantly reduced when the spawning location was moved close to the mouth of the river, with no modelled hatching if spawning occurred in the lower 8 km of the Don River, indicating that preventing Asian carp movement upstream would viably reduce the chances of successfully spawning occurring in this tributary. The magnitude of reduction in spawning success caused by limiting Asian carp passage upstream can guide preventative strategies and the method of using a 3-D hydrodynamic model as a predictive tool could be applied in similar tributaries across the Great Lakes basin.

Our objectives were to quantify patterns and habitat associations of adult bigheaded carp reproduction, larval production, and habitat use; such information is important for control strategies and identifying recruitment sources. During May-August 2011, we sampled adults and larvae at 10 sites distributed adjacent to and within the main channel of the Mississippi River at Pool 26 (study area = 28 river kilometers). Female reproductive status, adult location, and larval density were compared to environmental conditions, including temperature, site velocity, and turbidity. Large females spawned earlier than their smaller counterparts. No clear spawning aggregations of adults were observed, suggesting plasticity in staging habitat. Larvae were distributed across all sites during flooding. Larval density was positively related to velocity and turbidity, suggesting that nondepositional areas may facilitate recruitment. Bigheaded carp larvae comprised 10% of the ichthyofauna. Although pooled reaches are a source of recruitment for bigheaded carp in the Mississippi River system, the low densities of bigheaded carp larvae relative to native larvae cannot explain the dominance of adults in this system. Our findings provide insights into the plastic nature of bigheaded carp reproduction and habitats associated with larval development. Control efforts that target large adult females should be conducted earlier during the spring spawn. To maintain fishing pressure, such control efforts would likely need to continue through the summer, when smaller individuals spawn, discharge decreases, and CPUE increases. However, we found no specific mass staging area or habitat type where adult females could be targeted."

In the present work, we describe the construction of recombinant (r) common carp (Cyprinus carpio; c) FSH (rcFSH) and LH (rcLH) using the Pichia pastoris system, the generation of specific antibodies against their respective beta subunits, and their use in the development and validation of specific ELISAs. We produced carp rLH and rFSH as single-chain polypeptides, wherein the GTH subunit alpha was joined with either cLH beta or cFSH beta mature protein-coding sequences to form a fusion gene that encodes a yoked polypeptide, in which the GTH beta-subunit forms the N-terminal part and the alpha-subunit forms the C-terminal part. Competitive ELISAs were developed, using primary antibodies against rcLH beta or rcFSH beta respectively, and rcLH beta alpha or rcFSH beta alpha for the standard curves. The standard curves for cLH paralleled those of pituitary extracts of the homologous fish and also those of other cyprinids species like the black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus), goldfish (Carassius auratus), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). We used the specific antibodies raised against cFSH and cLH to study the specific localization of the different GTH cells in the pituitary of carp and its taxonomic relative species - the zebrafish. Both FSH and LH cells are localized in the center of the proximal pars distalis enveloping both sides of the neurohypophysis. LH cells form a continuous population throughout the PPD, while FSH cells are more loosely distributed throughout the same area and form small aggregations. Marked annual changes were encountered in gonadosomatic index (GSI), follicle diameter, mRNA levels and protein levels of FSH and LH. From September to November, all fish had low GSI, and the ovary contained previtellogenic follicles. From December, the GSI level increased and remained high until March, the follicular diameter reached its maximum in January, where the ovary contained large fully grown follicles. Thereafter, spawning occurred through March and April and ended in May, and GSI level and follicle diameter increased again; and the ovary contained mid-vitellogenic follicles. LH pituitary content and mRNA levels were low at pre- and early vitellogenesis, increasing gradually during this process to reach a peak of LH mRNA levels in mid vitellogenic ovary and a peak of LH content in fully grown ovarian follicles. However, no significant change occurred in FSH pituitary content and mRNA levels in vitellogenic fish and in fish during final maturation stages. A dramatic difference was found in the total content of each gonadotropin in the pituitary, with higher LH than FSH. Moreover, follicle diameter was positively and significantly correlated with LH pituitary content and its transcript levels - but not with the pituitary content or mRNA levels of FSH. Taken together, these results indicate that in carp, LH alone is sufficient to regulate both vitellogenesis and final oocyte maturation while FSH may have another, yet undefined role.

Using a large (2,935-L) mobile swim tunnel, the swimming performance of adult bighead and adult silver carp was quantified at water velocities that challenged them to exhibit either prolonged and/or burst swimming (76-244cm/s) with fatigue times of less than 10min. Simple log-linear models best described the relative swim speed to fatigue relationships for both species.

The decline in endurance with water velocity was three times greater in bighead carp (slope=-2.98) than in silver carp (slope=-1.01) and the predictive ability of the bighead model was appreciably better than the silver carp model. The differences in adult swimming performance between the two species were coincident with behavioral differences (e.g. breaching in silver carp but not in bighead carp).

Hypophthalmichthys molitrix"	"In this study, we explored the feasibility of vacuum frying to produce crisp silver carp surimi chips. The influence of three process parameters (frying temperature, frying time, and slice thickness) on the quality parameters of vacuum‐fried surimi chips (oil uptake, crispness, and optical properties) was investigated. The experimental results showed the optimal conditions were chosen as 2‐mm surimi slice being vacuum‐fried at 118°C for 2.5 min. Under these conditions, the oil content, breaking force, and color difference to commercial potato chips were 24.33%, 15.21 N, and 14.03, respectively. Additionally, we also measured the water loss during vacuum frying and the oil quality changes during storage of surimi chips. Results demonstrated the rapid loss of water content of surimi chips during vacuum frying and oil deterioration was kept at acceptable low level up to 100 days. Taken together, our study supported the applicability of vacuum frying technology to produce high‐quality silver carp surimi chips."	"10.1002/fsn3.1077"	"internal-pdf://2771447048/fgToA"

Silver carps were exposed to two cyanobacteria species (toxic and non-toxic) for RNA-seq and miRNA-seq analysis. RNA-seq revealed that the liver tissue contained 105,379 unigenes. Of these genes, 143 were significantly differentiated, 82 were markedly up-regulated, and 61 were remarkably down-regulated. GO term enrichment analysis indicated that 35 of the 154 enriched GO terms were significantly enriched. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that 17 of the 118 enriched KEGG pathways were significantly enriched. A considerable number of disease/immune-associated GO terms and significantly enriched KEGG pathways were also observed. The sequence length determined by miRNA-seq was mainly distributed in 20-23 bp and composed of 882,620 unique small RNAs, and 53% of these RNAs were annotated to miRNAs. As confirmed, 272 known miRNAs were differentially expressed, 453 novel miRNAs were predicted, 112 miRNAs were well matched with 7,623 target genes, and 203 novel miRNAs were matched with 15,453 target genes. qPCR also indicated that Steap4, Cyp7a1, CABZ01088134.1, and PPP1R3G were significantly differentially expressed and might play major roles in the toxic, detoxifying, and antitoxic mechanisms of microcystin in fish."

The O-CNDs were simply produced via a one-pot hydrothermal treatment of rhodamine B. The detection mechanism was based on the interaction between O-CNDs and MG, where the fluorescence of O-CNDs was suppressed by MG via a combined effect of inner filter effect (IFE) and dynamic suppressing. Under the optimum sensing conditions, the O-CNDs were found to display rapid reaction time (1.0 min), high selectivity and excellent sensitivity with two linear concentration ranges of 0.01-0.1 and 0.1-10.0 mu mol L-1, and the corresponding detection limits were as low as 0.08 and 0.93 nmol L-1, respectively. The developed fluorescence method was successfully applied for the determination of MG in fish samples, including silver carp, blackfish, blunt-snout bream, common carp and grass carp, with satisfactory results; the recoveries were in a range of 96.0-104.8 % and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) below 4.54 %. The results of this study validated the great potential of O-CNDs as an effective fluorescence sensing agent for MG monitoring in aquatic samples."

In order to investigate the profile of fish soup tastes and flavours cooked using different regions of the same fish, the silver carp was cut into four different regions: head, back, abdomen, and tail. The differences in taste and flavour of the four kinds of homemade fish soup were investigated by an electronic nose and electronic tongue. The basic chemical components of the different fish regions and the SDS-PAGE profile of the fish soup samples were investigated. Two chemometrics methods (principal component analysis and discriminant factor analysis) were used to classify the odour and taste of the fish soup samples. The results showed that the electronic tongue and nose performed outstandingly in discriminating the four fish soups even though the samples were made from different regions of the same fish. The taste and flavour information of different regions of the silver carp fish could provide the theoretical basis for food intensive processing."

To ascertain the effects of inulin, microbial transglutaminase (MTGase) and the combination of inulin/MTGase on gel formation of silver carp surimi, the gel strength, textural properties, water-holding capacity (WHC), dynamic rheological measurements, Raman spectroscopy, light microscopy of gel structure and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of gels from different groups were analyzed. The results showed that addition of inulin, MTGase and MTGase + inulin improved gel strength (increased by 7.7%, 26.8% and 38.56% compared with control group), textural properties and WHC. Raman spectroscopy proven that MTGase + inulin promoted the conversion of α-helixes to β-sheets and β-turns compared with other experimental and control groups. Pure surimi gelation contained a loose and non-heterogeneous network via light microscopy. With the addition of MTGase and inulin, the microstructure of surimi gelation became more compact and homogeneous, particularly the MTGase + inulin groups. Moreover, The SDS-PAGE pattern further disclosed that the MTGase + inulin had a weakened myosin heavy chain band, indicating that inulin could enhance the cross-linking effects of MTGase on myosin heavy chains. These data demonstrated inulin incorporating with MTGase may be a new and effective strategy to improve the gel properties of fish surimi."

Calibration of the AS-ISK scores, using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, identified 'basic risk assessment' and 'climate change assessment' threshold scores of 27.5 and 34.75, respectively, with which to distinguish species that pose a high risk of being invasive in the Ob basin and those that pose a low-to-medium risk.

FBBP preparation was obtained by papain treatment of minced bones and centrifugal ultrafiltration, and the molecular weight (MW) distribution was characterized by size exclusion and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). In vitro assessment of the effect of FBBP pretreatment in UVB-irradiated L929 fibroblasts and HaCaT keratinocytes revealed their cytoprotective activity. Their capacity to efficiently reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lipid peroxidation varied in a dose-dependent manner, and it was greater in fibroblasts. A decrease of proinflammatory cytokines secretion, in particular of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), was found after FBBP pretreatment of THP-1-derived inflamed macrophages. Melanin production and tyrosinase activity investigated in UVB-irradiated Mel-Juso cells were lowered in direct relation to FBBP concentrations. FBBP fractions with high radical scavenging activity were separated by ion exchange chromatography, and two collagenic sequences were identified. All these results offer new scientific data on aquaculture fish bone-derived peptides confirming their ability to control the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and pigmentation processes developed during UV irradiation of skin cells and recommend their use as valuable natural ingredients of photoprotective cosmeceutical products."

The Cs-137 distribution can be used for the estimation of internal radiation exposure through the consumption of fish and for the dose estimation of fish themselves. In this study, the Cs-137 distribution in the bodies of 8 freshwater fish species was investigated as percentages of total body burden for fish inhabiting Lake Inba. Fish samples were caught in stake nets placed close to the shore approximately once a month. After the measurement of body length and fresh weight, the radioactivities of Cs-137 in muscle, internal organs, spawn, milt and bone were assayed using high-purity germanium detectors. Analysis of all fish samples showed that the Cs-137 distribution was highest in muscle (54 +/- 12%), followed by internal organs (7.8 +/- 4.6%), spawn (7.4 +/- 5.4%), milt (3.2 +/- 2.1%) and bone (1.2 +/- 0.58%). Among fish species, the highest proportion of 137 Cs in muscle was detected in largemouth bass (71 +/- 1 3%), followed by snakehead (69 +/- 14%), channel catfish (63 +/- 17%), common carp (62 +/- 14%), barbel steed (58 +/- 6.5%), silver carp (57 +/- 7.7%), bluegill (53 +/- 4.7%), and crucian carp (50 +/- 10%). These results suggested that the 137 Cs in muscle was likely to be high in piscivorous fishes compared to omnivorous fishes, especially crucian carp. The proportion of Cs-137 in muscle of crucian carp was not explained either by body length or fresh weight. However, a positive correlation was found between the proportion of Cs-137 in muscle and the condition factor which was an indicator of nutritional status calculated from a length-weight relationship. This correlation implied that more Cs-137 accumulated in muscle tissue of a fish species with high nutritional status. This is the first study to show that condition factor is more important than body length and wet weight in explaining the high proportion of Cs-137 in muscle tissues, at least for crucian carp."

Silver carp is one of the most abundant freshwater fish speciesin the world. However, the rapid quality degradation soon after post-mortem makes them highly putrefactive while reducing the nutritional attributes. In this regard, our study aimed at applying organic acids to extend shelf-life of silver carp fish while investigating the quality attributes such as sensory, peroxide values, pH and microbial loads of the fish fillets during 9 days of refrigerated temperature storage (40C). Acetic acid and ascorbic acid are found to have strong antibacterial activities against different microorganisms. Fish fillets samples were treated with alone or in combination with acetic acid and ascorbic acid spray while keeping one group of fish fillets untreated. Total Viable Count (TVC) was found greater in the samples kept untreated and treated alone with acetic acid and ascorbic acid. However, fish fillets treated with acetic acid and ascorbic acid in combination were reported with lesser number of microbial counts. Moreover, Peroxide Value (PV) and pH were significantly lower in the sample treated with in combination of acetic acid and ascorbic acid. Sensory analysis revealed that fish fillets treated with combined treatment had better quality retention at the end of 9 days storage period. The findings suggest that the application of acetic acid and ascorbic acid alone or in different combination have the potential to decrease microbial loads while facilitating the shelf-life of fish fillets during 9 days of refrigerated temperature (40C) storage period."

The model tracks the daily consumption, mortality and growth of all individuals and the biomass dynamics of interacting prey pools. We ran simulation scenarios to determine the likelihood of BHC establishment under initial introductions from 5 to 1 million yearling and older individuals, and assuming variable age-0 carp survival rates (high, intermediate, and low). We bounded the survival of age-0 BHC as recruitment continues to be one of the biggest unknowns. We also simulated the potential effects of an established population of 1 million bighead carp or silver carp assuming variation in age-0 survival. Results indicated that as few as 10 BHC could establish a population assuming high or intermediate age-0 survival, but at least 100,000 individuals were needed to establish a population assuming low age-0 survival. BHC had negative effects on plankton and planktivorous fish biomass, which increased with BHC density. However, piscivorous walleye Sander vitreus appeared to benefit from BHC establishment. The potential for BHC to establish and affect ecologically and economically important fish species in Saginaw Bay is a cause for concern."

The frequency distribution of harvested fishes was skewed towards large fishes in solar heated greenhouse and smaller ones in open units. Water temperature ranged from 21.6-28.1 degrees C and 17.2-23.7 degrees C in the closed and open units, whereas mean temperature remained 4.5-5 degrees C higher in the former than in latter. There was no marked differences in total alkalinity (219-231 mg/l), inorganic carbon (289-417 mg/l), organic carbon (4.27-4.52 mg/l), dissolved oxygen (6.61-6.75 mg/l), total dissolved solids (420.48-423.74 mg/l) and conductivity (549.83-563.29 mu s/cm) between the closed and open enclosures, and remained within the range for fish culture. The score values of the sum total of the integrated ecological conditions revealed that similar to 5 degrees C rise in water temperature during winter enhanced as high as 36% increased yield of fish (2546 kg/ha) over open units mediated through microbial driven augmented manure mineralization leading to increased primary productivity, zooplankton abundance and ecological integrity. In essence, the solar heated greenhouse would be of considerable use for circumventing the retarded growth during winter in tropical fishes."

With the imminent threat of their movement into the Great Lakes, the goal of the present study was to assess whether differences in the physiological status between silver carp at the leading edge of their invasion front and core population sites could explain their lack of expansion upstream toward Lake Michigan over the past decade. A transcriptomic approach using RNA sequencing and analysis of plasma variables were used to quantify differences among fish at the leading edge and two downstream core population sites. Leading-edge fish exhibited upregulation of genes associated with xenobiotic defense (e.g., ATP-binding cassette C1 [abcc1], abcc2, abcc6), decreased cell integrity (i.e., macroautophagy and apoptosis; autophagy-related protein 9A [atg9a], caspase 3b [casp3b]), and cholesterol metabolism (e.g., abca1, apolipoprotein A1 [apoa1], sterol O-acyltransferase [soat1]) and downregulation of genes associated with DNA repair (e.g., tumor suppressor p53-binding protein 1 [tp53bp1]) compared to core population sites. Transcriptomic profiles of leading-edge fish were consistent with fish inhabiting a polluted environment and suggest that poorer water quality conditions upstream of the leading edge may represent a non-permanent barrier to silver carp range expansion. The present study provides potential molecular targets for monitoring the physiological status of silver carp over time and in response to future improvements in water quality upstream of their leading edge."

The lethal exposure significantly deteriorated the Ucrit of silver carps while the non-lethal exposure did not. Water temperature also impacted fish's swimming ability in TDG supersaturated water. The results can provide a reference for fish conservation during flood discharge. During flood discharges of upstream dams in the Yangtze River, the pelagic fish have a stress risk from total dissolved gas (TDG) supersaturation in the river water. This study took the silver carp as the object and systematically evaluated the effects of TDG supersaturation levels and exposure time on their critical swimming speed (Ucrit) at different temperatures. The external symptoms of gas bubble disease were found when TDG levels exceeded 130%. Both exposure time and TDG level did not significantly impact the Ucrit of fish under 6 days of non-lethal exposure (110%, 120%, 130% TDG) with lower or higher water temperature. Significant differences in Ucrit were found among different exposure times at 11.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C under 10 hours of lethal exposure (135%, 140%, 150% TDG) and the Ucrit reduced by 59.88%, 83.32%, and 92.40%, respectively. TDG level had a significant impact on the Ucrit at 21.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C when exposure time exceeded 8 hours. Ucrit at 21.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C water were significantly greater than those at 11.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C water where conditions had the same TDG supersaturation and exposure time. Differences in Ucrit between temperatures ranged from 3.24 to 6.12 BL/s under non-lethal exposure and from 6.38 to 13.88 BL/s under lethal exposure.

Settling characteristics are different depending on the physical and biological properties (such as density, diameter and surface viscosity). In this study, the terminal settling velocities of the floating eggs of four carps at different water hardening stages were measured. The terminal settling velocities of the eggs gradually decreased with water hardening process. The terminal settling velocity of the eggs of bighead carp was highest, followed by black carp, silver carp and grass carp. Subsequently, an empirical formula describing the relationship between the drag coefficient and the Reynolds number was developed. The applicability of this formula was investigated in drifting experiments. We proposed a formula for calculating the drag coefficient of floating fish eggs. The drag coefficient formula of the floating fish eggs is suitable for the Reynolds numbers below 490. At Reynolds numbers > 490, the drag coefficient was about 0.12. The results show that floating fish eggs differ significantly from other solid particles in their behavior and an own formula is necessary. This is the first study on the drag coefficient of the floating fish eggs.

Genetic maps, anchoring 71.7% and 83.8% of all scaffolds, were obtained for the silver and bighead carp, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the bighead carp formed a clade with the silver carp, with an estimated divergence time of 3.6 million years ago; the time of divergence between the silver carp and zebrafish was 50.7 million years ago. An East Asian cyprinid genome-specific chromosome fusion took place similar to 9.2 million years after this clade diverged from the clade containing the common carp and Sinocyclocheilus. KEGG and GO analyses indicated that the expanded gene families in the silver and bighead carp were associated with diseases, the immune system and environmental adaptations. Genomic regions differentiating the silver and bighead carp populations were detected based on the whole-genome sequences of 42 individuals.

Elements such as fish and poultry birds are integrated with transplanted wetland rice (Oryza sativa L.) for ensuring farmers' livelihoods and the nutritional security and sustainability of the system. Integrated animal components such as poultry birds and fish also supplement the system with weed control. The role and efficacy of these animal components as tools for managing weedy rice (Oryza sativa L.) were explored, as weedy rice infestation is increasing. This threat of weedy rice is due to scarcity of water resulting from poor water management and improper field leveling. Grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella val.) produced the highest reduction of weedy rice biomass, 28% within 24 h under laboratory conditions. Polyculture of C. idella, mrigal (Cirrhinus mrigala Ham.), and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix val.) reduced the biomass of weedy rice by 21% within 24 h. In laboratory studies, poultry manure at the highest concentration of 5% reduced the weedy rice seed germination 100% compared with rice seed germination at 91%. This conformed with microplot experiments in which poultry manure at 15.6 g d(-1) resulted in a weed control index (WCI) of 8% in both years. However, poultry manure at 15.6 g d(-1) in combination with herbicide application resulted in the highest control indices of weedy rice: 52% in 2017 and 2018.

Mississippi River"	"While invasions of large rivers by exotic fish species are well documented, assessing actual or potential impacts on native species is a challenge. Rapid assessments may be possible through the application of a combination of bioenergetic and population dynamic models.Paddlefish (Polyodon spathula) is a native species in the central USA with a history of population decline due to waterway development and overharvesting for roe. It is not known whether paddlefish are impacted by resource competition from invasive bigheaded carp populations, including silver (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis), which have expanded dramatically in the Mississippi River.We used bioenergetic models to project the potential impact of invasive silver and bighead carp on zooplankton density and paddlefish somatic growth in backwater habitat. Bioenergetic outputs were translated to impacts on fecundity, becoming inputs for 50‐year metapopulation simulations of backwater habitat connected to the main‐stem Mississippi River by episodic flood events.Competition with carp reduced growth and increased the risk of population decline for paddlefish. Impacts increased disproportionately with increased carp abundance and were further exacerbated in scenarios with increased diet overlap or decreased zooplankton abundance.We also analysed paddlefish condition data collected at sites near the lower Mississippi River with varying histories of carp invasion. These data give credence to the bioenergetic model output; paddlefish had reduced body condition at sites with long‐established, high‐density carp populations.We conclude that invasive bigheaded carps have great potential to reduce paddlefish growth, fecundity, and abundance. The pairing of bioenergetics and population models is likely to be broadly useful in assessing the risks posed by other invasive species."

However, the composition, diversity, and function of microbiota associated with certain niches in fish bodies and fish habitats remain to be elucidated. In the present study, 16S sequencing was carried out to compare microbial communities found in the gills and guts in two filter-feeding fish (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and to determine the influence of sediment and water on fish microbiota in an unfed aquaculture system. Results revealed significant variations in the water, sediment, gill, and gut microbial communities of the two filter-feeding fish in terms of composition, core taxa, diversity, and predictive function. Microbial diversity was significantly higher in the habitat samples (water and sediment) than in the fish host samples (gill and gut) and was significantly higher in the gills than in the gut. Both body niche (i.e., gill vs gut) and host species significantly impacted the fish-associated microbiota, but permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and cluster analysis of core taxa indicated that the effect of body niche outweighed that of the host species in influencing the microbial community. Host microbial communities were more similar to the water microbiota than the sediment microbiota. Source tracking analysis further confirmed that water had a greater contribution than sediment to the fish microbiota, consistent with their upper water-layer habitats. The gill and gut possessed unique core microbiota and predictive functions in comparison to the surrounding environment.

A total of 137 phytoplankton species belonging to 8 divisions were recorded indicating rich phytoplankton diversity in the North Indian reservoir. Bacillariophyta contributed the highest number of species followed by Chlorophyta. Filamentous algae such as Geitlerinema sp., Pseudoanabaena sp., Oscillatoria sp. and Phormidium sp. were highly abundant. The contribution of the top ten species ranged between 63% and 98% of total phytoplankton density. PCA analysis of physico-chemical revealed six principal components (HCO3, TDS, BOD, DOM, air temperature and pH) which significantly affected the succession of phytoplankton in Jargo Reservoir. The CCA analysis of phytoplankton species and physico-chemical parameters revealed that Ochrophyta and Miozoa were highly influenced by high CO2 and PO4. Higher phytoplankton diversity and species richness were observed during the late winter season and rainy season, respectively. Our investigation recommends that fish production in the reservoir could be enhanced by stocking with fingerlings of silver carp, which has the potential to utilise the unconsumed population of abundant Myxophyta."

Fish parasites proliferate quickly in favourable settings, compromising fish health and frequently resulting in high mortality. Identifying and implementing appropriate control techniques is the need of the hour to combat the diseases. Emamectin benzoate (EMB) is an efficient infeed therapy for ectoparasite control in fish. The aim of the present study was to determine the withdrawal period of EMB in silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) commercially important fish species in southeast Asia. The depletion of EMB residues in silver carp muscle treated with a dose of 50 mu g kg(-1) body weight (BW) day(-1) for seven consecutive days was assessed. Muscle tissue was sampled on the 7th day of EMB feeding and 1st-, 3rd-, 7th-, 14th-, 21st-, 35th- and 41st-day post-medication (PM) for QTRAP 4000 LC-MS/MS analysis. The data revealed that the level of EMB in the fish muscle was 13.0 +/- 0.1 parts per billion (ppb) on the 0th day of withdrawal. The residue levels were reduced significantly on the 3rd day, with traces of EMB recorded by 21st-day PM and reached undetectable levels by 31st day PM. Considering the maximum residue limit (MRL) of 100 mu g kg(-1) for fish muscle, the present study's findings support the usage of EMB in silver carp under the conditions employed in the study. The current study provides crucial information on the use of EMB as an antiparasiticide in silver carp, considering the food safety issues."

In case of Lake Balaton, irreversible changes include the reduction of lake level and subsequent construction directly on the lakeshore as well as introduction of foreign species such as eel and silver carp. Reasons for the negative results/impacts of the introduced interventions are: insufficient level of technical or scientific knowledge at the time of planning and implementation; poor decision support systems and mechanisms; insufficient consultation with local people and experts of other fields; lack of integrated approach, both in terms of territorial and interdisciplinary aspects; and pursuing of short term economic or political benefits. Compared to the situation one and a half centuries ago, many of the reasons leading to adverse effects can be eliminated because technical and scientific knowledge is increasing with high speed and huge amount of monitoring, etc. data are becoming available; decision support systems and mechanisms are getting faster and are improving in complexity; consultation with, participation, and empowerment of local people, stakeholders and a diverse choice of experts are becoming basic requirements in environmental and spatial development policy; integrated approaches both in terms of territorial and interdisciplinary aspects are gathering momentum.

Bigheaded carp were accidentally introduced into the lower Mississippi River basin in the early 1970s and have since invaded many water bodies in the Midwestern United States. Evidence of bigheaded carp reproduction and recruitment in the upper Mississippi River upstream of Lock and Dam 19 (LD19) at Keokuk, Iowa, thought to be a critical constriction point to their upstream establishment, has been limited to a few isolated detections of eggs, larvae, and juvenile life stages since 2012. Therefore, a more comprehensive assessment of bigheaded carp reproduction in this critical management zone was needed. We used quadrafoil light traps (n = 1,387) deployed during May-September 2016-2018 in Pools 17-19 of the Mississippi River to monitor for advanced larval bigheaded carp in low-velocity habitats. Throughout the sampling period, we captured 1,747 larval and 35 postlarval bigheaded carp (N = 1,782). Bigheaded carp were collected on 15 sampling events that spanned from May 31, 2016, to September 13, 2018, with associated hatch dates estimated to represent 10 unique reproductive events from May 2016 to September 2018. The individual captures and backdated hatch estimates revealed a protracted spawning period of up to seven events in 2016, one event in 2017, and two events in 2018. Bigheaded carp were only captured in Pool 19, possibly due to the drifting requirements for egg maturation and the low-velocity downstream reach of Pool 19. This research provides confirmation that bigheaded carp spawned upstream of LD19 are capable of transitioning past the yolk sac stage upstream of this bottleneck to more advanced larval stages. Knowledge of reproduction and larval retention and the field-based evidence of protracted spawning fill critical research gaps needed for the management of bigheaded carp."

Despite observed F1 hybrid superiority in experimental settings, effects of postzygotic selection on bighead and silver carp hybrids have not been tested in a natural system. Individual parent and hybrid genotypes were resolved at 57 species‐specific loci and used to evaluate postzygotic selection for body condition (Wr) and female reproductive potential (presence of spawning stage gonads and gonadosomatic index [GSI]) in the MRB during 2009–2011. Body condition in the Marseilles Reach, Illinois River declined with a decrease in species‐specific allele frequency from 1.0 to 0.4 for each species and early generation hybrids (F1, F2, and first‐generation backcross) had lower mean Wr than late generation hybrids (2nd+ generation backcrosses) and parentals. Proportions of stage IV and stage V (spawning stage) female gonads differed between bighead and silver carp, but not among parentals and their early and late generation hybrids within the MRB. Mean GSI values did not differ between parentals and hybrids. Because reproductive potential did not differ between hybrids and parentals, our results suggest that early generation hybrids occur in low frequency either as a factor of poor condition (Wr) and postreproductive survival, infrequent reproductive encounters by parental bighead and silver carp, or selection pressures acting on juvenile or immature life stages. Our results suggest that a combination of genetic and environmental factors may contribute to the postzygotic success of bighead and silver carp hybrids in the Mississippi River Basin."

The objective of this study was to determine whether the sizes of the chewing pad (CP), pharyngeal teeth (PT), and pharyngeal arch (PA)-the Silver Carp structures most often found intact in predator diets-were predictive of the TL of prey Silver Carp.

Using simple linear regression, we found a strong predictive relationship between measurements of CP, PT, or PA and the TL of Silver Carp. The CPL (r(2) = 0.94) and CPW (r(2) = 0.94) had the strongest relationships with Silver Carp TL, followed by PA1 (r(2) = 0.89) and PT1(L) (r(2) = 0.87).

We also tested for inhibition by high concentrations of exogenous DNA, hypothesizing that DNA from increasingly closely related species would be increasingly inhibitory. All tested inhibitors impacted qPCR, though only at very high concentrations - likely a function, in part, of having used an inhibitor-resistant qPCR solution. Closer phylogenetic relatedness resulted in inhibition at lower exogenous DNA concentrations, but not at relatively close phylogenetic scales. Inhibition was also influenced by the qPCR reporter dye used. Importantly, different qPCR assays responded differently to the same inhibitor concentrations. Implications of these results are that the inclusion of more than one assay for the same target taxa in an eDNA survey may be an important countermeasure against false negatives and that internal positive controls may not, in the absence of efforts to maximize inhibition compatibility, provide useful information about the inhibition of an eDNA assay."

However, in order for eDNA monitoring to mature as a research and management tool, there are several critical knowledge gaps that must be filled. One such gap is the fate of eDNA materials in the aquatic environment. Understanding the environmental factors that influence the decay of eDNA and how these factors impact detection probabilities over time and space could have significant implications for eDNA survey design and data interpretation. Here we experimentally explore decay of eDNA associated with bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) biological waste collected from an aquaculture filtration system and with sperm collected from captive silver carp (H. molitrix), and how decay may be influenced by differing levels of water turbulence, temperature, microbial load, and pH. We found that the decay patterns of eDNA associated with both H. nobilis biological waste and H. molitrix milt significantly fit monophasic exponential decay curves. Secondly, we observed that the highest temperature we tested resulted in a decay half-life as much as 5.5× more rapid than the lowest temperature we tested. When we suppressed microbial loads in eDNA samples, we observed that overall losses of eDNA were reduced by about 2.5×. When we amended eDNA samples with pond water the half-life of eDNA was reduced by about 2.25×, despite relatively little apparent increase in the overall microbial load. This pattern indicated that species constituency of the microbial community, in addition to microbial load, might play a critical role in eDNA degradation. A shift in pH from 6.5 to 8.0 in the samples resulted in a 1.6× reduction in eDNA half-life. Water turbulence in our study had no apparent effect on eDNA decay. When we combined different temperature, pH, and microbial load treatments to create a rapid decay condition and a slow decay condition, and tracked eDNA decay over 91 days, we observed a 5.0× greater loss of eDNA by Day 5 under rapid decay conditions than under slow decay conditions. At the end of the trials, the differences in eDNA loss between the rapid decay and baseline and slow decay conditions were 0.1× and 3.3×, respectively. Our results strongly demonstrate the potential for environmental factors to influence eDNA fate and, thus, the interpretation of eDNA survey results."

Previously published evidence for spawning of these species in the upper Mississippi River has been limited to an area just downstream of Dam 22 (near Saverton, Missouri). In 2013 and 2014, we sampled ichthyoplankton at 18 locations in the upper Mississippi River main stem from Dam 9 through Dam 19 and in four tributaries of the Mississippi River (Des Moines, Skunk, Iowa, and Wisconsin rivers). We identified eggs and larvae by using morphological techniques and then used genetic tools to confirm species identity. The spawning events we observed often included more than one species of Asian carp and in a few cases included eggs that must have been derived from more than one upstream spawning event. The upstream extent of genetically confirmed Grass Carp ichthyoplankton was the Wisconsin River, while Bighead Carp and Silver Carp ichthyoplankton were observed in Pool 16. In all these cases, ichthyoplankton likely drifted downstream for several hours prior to collection. Higher water velocities (and, to a lesser extent, higher temperatures) were associated with an increased likelihood of observing eggs or larvae, although the temperature range we encountered was mostly above 17 degrees C. Several major spawning events were detected in 2013, but no major spawning events were observed in 2014. The area between Dam 15 and Dam 19 appears to be the upstream edge of spawning activity for both Silver Carp and Bighead Carp, suggesting that this area could be a focal point for management efforts designed to limit further upstream movement of these species."

Invasive species may display reproductive strategies that allow successful reproduction in varying environments, such as batch and protracted spawning. Bighead Carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and Silver Carp H. molitrix, referred to as bigheaded carp, are invasive species that have been introduced worldwide. In some invaded ranges, they either have a protracted spawning period and/or spawn multiple times in a season, which can be advantageous in novel environments. Reproductive strategies can vary between river systems or with environmental conditions, and understanding differences in strategies can improve management of bigheaded carp. To determine reproductive strategy, we evaluated the histology of spawning capable ovaries from Silver Carp (n = 58) and Bighead Carp (n = 38) collected during May-September 2016 and June 2017 from Pools 17-20 of the upper Mississippi River (UMR). We found that 87.9% of Silver Carp (n = 51) and 86.8% of Bighead Carp (n = 33) had an ovary that contained primary growth, cortical alveolar, and vitellogenic oocytes simultaneously. Multiple stages of oocytes within an ovary indicated that individuals were capable of spawning multiple times during a single year, and the presence of postovulatory follicle complexes demonstrated that individuals had already spawned while oocytes were still present. Based on histological samples, bigheaded carp appear to be indeterminate batch spawners, with oocytes continuing to develop throughout the spawning period. Silver and Bighead carp in the UMR may exhibit protracted and batch spawning and employ flexible spawning strategies among different river systems, which can increase the probability of successful recruitment in a variable environment."

Therefore, the ability to estimate fecundity from field measurements (i.e., TL, relative weight [W-r], or ovary weight) can be a valuable tool for fisheries managers to estimate reproductive potential. The goal of this study was to relate the batch fecundity of invasive Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Bighead Carp H. nobilis to metrics that can be quickly measured to eliminate the need for direct enumeration. Silver and Bighead carp were collected from the upper Mississippi River (UMR) in the summer of 2016 and 2017. Subsamples of mature (spawning capable) ovaries were preserved, enumerated, and then related to ovary weight, TL, weight, and W-r. An equation for estimating Silver Carp batch fecundity from ovary weight in the UMR, corrected for ovary membrane weight, was developed: {ovary weight - [0.222 x (ovary weight(0.7589))]} x 794 (SE = 11). Batch fecundity for Silver Carp from Pools 17-20 of the UMR averaged 1,230,930 +/- 68,983 eggs (mean +/- SE). Ovary weight was the strongest predictor of fecundity, but TL, weight, and W-r also showed significant relationships with fecundity for Silver Carp. Batch fecundity for Bighead Carp averaged 1,043,953 +/- 82,360 eggs, but the number of eggs per gram showed significant spatial variation; therefore, no fecundity equation was developed for this species. Future work should evaluate the frequency of Silver Carp spawns within a season and how batch fecundity varies among multiple spawning events. Fecundity estimates can be used to determine spawning potential ratios, which can help in evaluating management strategies."

Thus, developing new source of materials with the ability to resist calcification is an imperative demand of clinical. In our previous work, swim bladder was proved with superb calcification-resistance as a promising candidate for cardiovascular biomaterials. To find the optimal choice of swim bladder, we herein further investigated four types of swim bladders including grass carp (GC), culter alburnus (CA), carp (C) and silver carp (SC) as material source of the BHVs. Data showed that all the swim bladder was mainly composed of elastin fiber, collagen fiber and glycosaminoglycan (GAG). All the groups except GC group can meet the basic mechanical and materials stability requirements as BHVs. Moreover, the calcification of swim bladder derived from SC was proved significantly lower than that of CA and C groups with in vivo rat subcutaneous implantation model. Additionally, in vitro assays demonstrated that four types of swim bladder exhibited well hemocompatibility and cytocompatibility. Collectively, the superior properties including low calcification, adequate mechanical, high stability, as well as excellent hemocompatibility and cytocompatibility of SC-derived swim bladder endow it great competence as BHVs."

Yangtze River"	"Bighead carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix have been two economically important aquaculture species in China for centuries. In the past decades, bighead and silver carp have been introduced from the Yangtze River to many river systems in China, including the Pearl River, in annual, large‐scale, stocking activities to enhance wild fisheries. Nonetheless, few studies have assessed the ecological or genetic impacts of such introductions on native conspecific fish populations. An mtDNA D‐loop segment of 978 bp from 213 bighead carp samples from 9 populations and a 975 bp segment from 204 silver carp samples from 10 populations were obtained to evaluate genetic diversity and population integrity. Results from a haplotype network analysis revealed that most haplotypes of the Pearl River clustered with those of Yangtze River origin and only a small proportion were distinct, suggesting that both the native Pearl River bighead and silver carp populations are currently dominated by genetic material from the Yangtze River. The genetic diversity of Pearl River populations is high in both species because of this inter‐population gene flow, but the diversity of native Pearl River populations is low. To preserve the native genetic diversity, stocking of non‐native fingerlings should cease immediately and native Pearl River bighead and silver carp fish farms should be established. This research demonstrates the danger to native biodiversity across China because of the substantial, ongoing stock‐enhancement activities without prior genetic assessment."

This study aimed to describe the characteristics of the aquatic ecosystem of Lake Shangshe (Yangtze River Basin, China) and propose suggestions to improve CBF practices using an Ecopath with Ecosim model. Based on the direction of water flow and different product supply services, different practices were implemented in the 3 sub-lakes of Lake Shangshe (upper lake area, ULA; middle lake area, MLA; lower lake area, LLA) between 2014 and 2015. Asian carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, H. nobilis, Cteno-pharyngodon idella, Cyprinus carpio) and bream (Megalobrama amblycephala, Parabramis pekinensis) were stocked at 30.0 and 50.0 t km(-2) in the ULA and MLA, respectively. In the LLA, the same fish species were stocked at 50.0 t km(-2) and millet grass Echinochloa sp. was planted. Water quality, including physicochemical parameters, was monitored in the 3 sub-lakes. Total phosphorus and chemical oxygen demand were significantly lower in the ULA than in the MLA and LLA. Ecotrophic efficiency values were noticeably high for most of the functional groups, except small pelagic fishes and cyanobacteria. Mixed trophic impact analyses demonstrated high fishing pressure on piscivorous fishes. The total mean transfer efficiency (TE) was 14.4%. The ratios of total primary production to total respiration, total primary production to total biomass, and total biomass to total throughput were 1.847, 46.131, and 0.008, respectively. In conclusion, the TE and ecosystem maturity of the aquatic ecosystem of Lake Shangshe were higher than those of other lakes in China, with the trialed CBF practices having a positive effect on both factors."

Existing egg drift models simulate the fluvial transport of carp eggs but have limitations in capturing the effect of localized turbulence on egg transport due to inadequate dimensions of hydrodynamics and/or empirical parameterization of river dispersion. We present a three-dimensional Lagrangian particle tracking model that uses fully resolved river hydrodynamics and a continuous random walk algorithm driven by local turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate. We incorporate a new set of equations to compute evolving egg characteristics with fully resolved 3-D hydrodynamics. To demonstrate the performance of the model, we conducted a case study in an eight-kilometer reach of the Missouri River at the discharge of approximately 25% daily flow exceedance. Three-dimensional river hydrodynamics was modeled, calibrated, and evaluated with measurement data. Egg drift was modeled and compared using fully three-dimensional, depth-averaged two-dimensional, and zone-averaged one-dimensional hydrodynamics. The comparison shows a generally good agreement among models of downstream egg transport due to advection but a different dispersion pattern of eggs in the river, as a result of turbulent diffusion and shear induced dispersion."

Infection"	"Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) is known as a highly conserved adipokine for immune activation. Aeromonas hydrophila (A. hydrophila) is the most common zoonotic pathogen in aquaculture, which causes serious economic losses to aquaculture, especially to bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, H. nobilis) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, H. molitrix). Recent studies along with our previous findings have shown that synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing CpG motifs (CpG ODN) can play a good role in aquatic animals against infection. In order to clarify the relationship between CpG ODN and RBP4 under A. hydrophila infection, firstly, full-length RBP4 cDNAs from H. nobilis and H. molitrix were cloned. And characteristics of RBP4, including sequence and structure, tissue distribution and genetic evolution were analyzed. In addition, mRNA expression levels of RBP4, cytokine, toll-like receptors (TLRs), morbidity and survival rates of H. nobilis and H. molitrix were observed post CpG ODN immunization or following challenge. The results indicated that hn/hm_RBP4 (RBP4 genes obtained from H. nobilis and H. molitrix) had the highest homology with Megalobrama amblycephala. Distribution data showed that the expression level of hn_RBP4 mRNA was higher than that of hm_RBP4. After CpG ODN immunization followed by A.hydrophila challenge, significantly higher survival was observed in both carps, together with up-regulated RBP4 expression. Meanwhile, hn/hm_IL-1β level was relatively flat (and decreased), hn/hm_IFN-γ, hn/hm_TLR4 and hn/hm_TLR9 levels increased significantly, but hn/hm_STRA6 showed no significant change, compared with control. Moreover, CpG ODN immunization could induce stronger immune protective responses (higher IFN-γ/gentle IL-1β level and lower morbidity/higher survival rate) against A. hydrophila in H. nobilis, along with higher RBP4 level, when compared with that in H. molitrix. These results demonstrated that RBP4 was well involved in the immune protection of CpG ODN. Based on the results, we speculated that in the case of A. hydrophila infection, TLR9 signaling pathway was activated by CpG ODN. Subsequently, CpG ODN up-regulated RBP4, and RBP4 activated TLR4 signaling pathway. Then TLR4 and TLR9 synergistically improved the anti-infection responses. Our findings have good significance for improving resistance to pathogen infection in freshwater fish."

The gill is the first tissue attacked by hypoxia; however, the response of the gills of H. molitrix to hypoxia stress at the tissue, cellular, and molecular levels has not been clearly established. The influence of hypoxia on histological features along with gene expression in silver carp gills were explored in this research. The hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections and electron microscopy examinations of gills indicated that the gill lamellae were seriously twisted, gill filaments were dehisced, and the swelling and shedding of epithelial cell layer in the gill tissue were intensified along with the degree of hypoxia. In the hypoxia, semi-asphyxia, and asphyxia groups, the gill transcriptomic assessment of shifts in key genes, as well as modulatory networks in response to hypoxic conditions revealed 587, 725, and 748 differentially expressed genes, respectively. These genes are abundant in immune response signaling cascades (e.g., complement and coagulation cascades, Nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor signaling cascade, and differentiation of Th1 along with Th2 cells) and oxygen transport [e.g., MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling cascades]. Genes linked to immune response (e.g., c2, c3, c6, klf4, cxcr4, cd45, and cd40) and oxygen transport (e.g., egln1, egln3, epo, ldh, and vegfa) were additionally identified. According to our findings, the silver carp may be using "HIF-1" to obtain additional oxygen during hypoxia. These findings illustrate that hypoxia stress might damage gill tissue, trigger an immunological response, and activate HIF-1 signaling to increase oxygen availability under hypoxic situations. The findings of this work will help scientists better understand the molecular mechanisms driving hypoxia responses in hypoxia-sensitive fish and speed up the development of hypoxia-resistant varieties."

In the present study, three PHD genes were cloned from H. molitrix by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The total length of HmPHD1, HmPHD2, and HmPHD3 were 2981, 1954, and 1847 base pair (bp), and contained 1449, 1080, and 738 bp open reading frames (ORFs) that encoded 482, 359, and 245 amino acids (aa), respectively. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that HmPHD1, HmPHD2, and HmPHD3 had the conserved prolyl 4-hydroxylase alpha subunit homolog domains at their C-termini. Meanwhile, the evaluation of phylogeny revealed PHD2 and PHD3 of H. molitrix were more closely related as they belonged to sister clades, whereas the clade of PHD1 was relatively distant from these two. The transcripts of PHD genes are ubiquitously distributed in H. molitrix tissues, with the highest expressional level of HmPHD1 and HmPHD3 in liver, and HmPHD2 in muscle. After acute hypoxic treatment for 0.5 h, PHD genes of H. molitrix were induced mainly in liver and brain, and different from HmPHD1 and HmPHD2, the expression of HmPHD3 showed no overt tissue specificity. Furthermore, under continued hypoxic condition, PHD genes exhibited an obviously rapid but gradually attenuated response from 3 h to 24 h, and upon reoxygenation, the transcriptional expression of PHD genes showed a decreasing trend in most of the tissues. These results indicate that the PHD genes of H. molitrix are involved in the early response to hypoxic stress, and they show tissue-specific transcript expression when performing physiological regulation functions. This study is of great relevance for advancing our understanding of how PHD genes are regulated when addressing the hypoxic challenge and provides a reference for the subsequent research of the molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxia adaptation in silver carp."

Both groups were maintained at 25 degrees C and, at the end of the experimental period, the total movement distance (TMD), percent time spent moving (PTM), ventilation frequency (V-f), pre-exercise oxygen consumption (M(center dot)O-2) and EPOC response of the experimental fish were measured. The TMD and PTM obtained for the control group of southern catfish were lower than those found for the control groups of the three active species. Short-term fasting resulted in decreases in the TMD and PTM of the southern catfish and black carp and increases in the TMD of grass carp and silver carp. The V-f of southern catfish was significantly higher than those of grass carp and silver carp, whereas the latter was also significantly higher than that of black carp. Short-term fasting resulted in significant increases in the V-f and decreases in the pre-exercise M(center dot)O-2 of southern catfish and silver carp. Southern catfish and black carp exhibited lower peak postexercise M(center dot)O-2 and recovery rates, and relatively higher EPOC magnitudes than grass carp and silver carp. Short-term fasting exerted no significant effects on the peak post-exercise M(center dot)O-2, but resulted in relatively higher EPOC magnitudes in the four fish species. These results suggest that (1) different fish species exhibit significantly different levels of spontaneous activity and post-exercise M(center dot)O-2 profiles with different characteristics and that (2) short-term fasting exerts different effects on the level of spontaneous activity in four fish species with different foraging strategies."

The tested aquaculture models included monoculture of largemouth bass (MC), polyculture of largemouth bass, gibel carp Carassius auratus gibelio and silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (PC), and integrated culture of largemouth bass, gibel carp, silver carp and freshwater pearl mussel Hyriopsis cumingii (IC). The ratio of largemouth bass, gibel carp and silver carp was 30:2:1 in the PC model, and the ratio of largemouth bass, gibel carp, silver carp and mussel was 30:2:1:5 in the IC model. The largemouth bass were fed with formulated feed twice daily. No significant differences were found in weight gain and yield of largemouth bass, total fish yield, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) utilization efficiencies, N and P wastes, pH, nitrite, nitrate, reactive phosphate, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total organic carbon, chemical oxygen demand, 5‐day biochemical oxygen demand, chlorophyll a, primary productivity among the MC, PC and IC models. The ammonia was lower, while the dissolved oxygen was higher in the PC tanks than in the MC tanks. These results suggest that the environment situation was better in the PC tanks relative to that in the MC tanks. The present study reveals that the PC model should be a way to optimize the aquaculture model for commercial largemouth bass farming."

With adding amount of TGase increasing, the crosslinking degree of surimi gels increased, the surface hydrophobicity reduced progressively, and high molecular polymers formed. The relationship between content of free amino acids and digestion time of surimi gels showed an S-shaped curve and could fit the Logistic equation (x = Mx(0)/x(0)+(M-x(0))e(-kMt)) well (R-2=0.957-0.998).

Most relevant models are nonlinear, however, and data available from real world ecosystems are too noisy and sparsely sampled for common inference approaches. Here we improved the inference of generalized Lotka–Volterra (gLV) ecological networks by using a new optimization algorithm to constrain parameter signs with prior knowledge and a perturbation-based ensemble method. Results We applied the new inference to long-term species abundance data from the freshwater fish community in the Illinois River, United States. We constructed an ensemble of 668 gLV models that explained 79% of the data on average. The models indicated (at a 70% level of confidence) a strong positive interaction from emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides) to channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), which we could validate using data from a nearby observation site, and predicted that the relative abundances of most fish species will continue to fluctuate temporally and concordantly in the near future. The network shows that the invasive silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) has much stronger impacts on native predators than on prey, supporting the notion that the invader perturbs the native food chain by replacing the diets of predators. Conclusions Ensemble approaches constrained by prior knowledge can improve inference and produce networks from noisy and sparsely sampled time series data to fill knowledge gaps on real world ecosystems. Such network models could aid efforts to conserve ecosystems such as the Illinois River, which is threatened by the invasion of the silver carp."

There were four treatments with three replicates each: crucian carp (50 fish) fed with low (8.7 g/ kg) or high phosphorous (13.5 g/ kg) diets (L1 and H1), and polyculture (50 crucian carp + 10 silver carp + 10 bighead carp) fed with low or high-phosphorus diets (L3 and H3). Results suggested that polyculture with filter feeders suppresses crucian carp growth, especially when supplied with low phosphorus diet. Polyculture significantly enhanced the total fish production when crucian carp were fed a diet with high P levels. Dietary P level and polyculture with silver and bighead carp did not affect dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, water transparency, NH4+-N, total nitrogen, or any form of phosphorus (p < 0.05), while the presence of filter feeders significantly suppressed plankton. The present experiment suggested that silver carp is more suitable for polyculture with crucian carp, and a higher P level is needed to support plankton and reduce competition with crucian carp."

As a pivotal environmental factor that affects fish migration and population distribution, the low‐velocity flow has not drawn enough attention despite its extensive presence in various ecoregions.To understand the behavioural profiles of fish in low‐velocity flow, we examined the motility and swimming performance of two representative cyprinids, grass carp (GC, Ctenopharyngodon idella) and silver carp (SC, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), under the combined effect of different flow velocities and illuminance ranges.The two species were exposed to two flow velocities (0.15 and 0.25 m/s) and three illuminance ranges (100.0–0.9 lx, 300.0–2.5 lx, and 700.0–4.9 lx). A novel behavioural metric, composed of light preference, swimming speed, rheotaxis index (RI), swimming stability (SS), and the probability of moving forwards/backwards over a certain distance (PMf‐0.1 and PMb‐0.1), was developed to fully characterise the motion strategy of fish.By analysing the individual distribution in light gradient, we confirmed the scototaxis of GC and found the oscillating light preference in SC that changed from 84.41–10.18 to 6.00–2.08 lx and disappeared with increasing illuminance. The RI and SS increased at the fast flow velocity (0.25 m/s) for both species, and SC was more forward‐prone and more stable than GC. Despite the fluctuating light preference, the higher illuminances heightened the RI and SS in SC, while in GC, higher illuminances inhibited the SS and had no impact on the RI. The results of PMf‐0.1 and PMb‐0.1 indicated that a higher flow velocity could facilitate the temporary upstream swimming in both species, while illuminance could only promote the same effect in SC.Finally, our study proposed possible manoeuvres in fine‐scale spatio‐temporal scenarios such as attraction flow and non‐traditional passages and provided valuable insights into fish community dynamics, laying the groundwork for alleviating the threat from invasive species and for future fish population recovery."

Knowledge of the basic characteristics of fish assemblages in reservoirs is a first step toward the development of effective conservation policies. We used the information collected over a 10-year period (2006-2015) to assess the structure of the fish assemblages in the Three Gorge Reservoir (TGR) in a river-dam gradient. Three fish zones were detected in TGR. Species richness was the highest in the upper zone and lowest in the lower zone. The riverine zones were dominated by rheophilic species Coreius guichenoti and Pelteobagrus vachelli. The transitional zones were dominated by Coreius heterodon and Rhinogobio cylindricus. The lacustrine zones were dominated by eurytopic species Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Aristichthys nobilis, Hemiculter bleekeri and Cvprinus carpio. For the functional characteristics, fish assemblages in riverine and transitional zones were dominated by insectivorous species, equilibrium strategists and rheophilic species (e.g., Coreius heterodon and Coreius guichenoti). In lacustrine zones, the fish assemblage was dominated by habitat generalists common to lakes and reservoirs (e.g., Hemiculter bleekeri, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Aristichthys nobilis). Moreover, 18 exotic species (e.g., Protosalanx hyalocranius, Ictalurus punctatus, Megalobrama amblycephala, Tilapia) were collected in TGR, most of which only existed in the lacustrine zone. The results highlight the importance of freely flowing riverine reaches for conserving native fish in the upper Changjiang River and adaptive management strategies for fisheries in TGR."

However, field investigations have showed that such stocking would enhance instead of controlling phyto-plankton in these reservoirs. Reservoirs generally receive a considerable amount of detritus from their catch-ments which may constitute an important carbon source to filter-feeding fish. Whether direct consumption of detritus increases the availability of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (P) to phytoplankton and thereby provides resilience against the control of phytoplankton biomass is debated. We conducted an enclosure experiment in a (sub)tropical Chinese reservoir (Liuxihe Reservoir) to assess how a gradient of filter-feeding fish (Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) biomass affected P dynamics and fish grazing and predation when subsidized by allochthonous detritus. Fish had strong effects on the dynamics and fluxes of P. TP concentration in the water column increased over time in all enclosures, but the presence of fish slowed its increase. Thus, TP decreased with increasing fish biomass. Fish were a net sink of P to the water column, because they gained mass during the experiment. Moreover, P sequestered by fish could largely account for the lower TP concentrations observed in enclosures with fish compared to fishless enclosures. Fish presence at high biomass strongly reduced the abundance of large zooplankton species and P excretion by zooplankton. However, the negative effect of fish predation on zooplankton was negligible when fish was present at low biomass. Increasing fish biomass increased the relative role of fish in P cycling but decreased the overall P excretion by fish and zooplankton. Compared to enclosures with high fish biomass, both zooplankton grazing effect on phytoplankton (zooplankton: phyto-plankton biomass ratio as a proxy) and the overall P excretion were much higher, whereas fish grazing effect on phytoplankton (fish: phytoplankton biomass ratio as a proxy), chlorophyll a and the yield of chlorophyll a per TP were much lower in enclosures with low fish biomass. This suggested that phytoplankton limitation might shift from one of zooplankton control to one of limitation by P availability with increasing fish biomass. Relative to fish mediated P recycling and fish grazing, zooplankton grazing appeared to be more important as a driver of trophic cascades in systems subsidized by allochthonous detritus. Silver Carp stocked at high biomass would strongly reduce zooplankton grazing pressure and increase the yield of phytoplankton per TP."

Bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) are two of the most important edible fish in Asia, which have a long juvenility period that can lasts for 4-5 years. In this study, we found one sex-specific marker by next-generation sequencing together with bioinformatics analysis in bighead carp. The male-specific markers were used to perform molecular sexing in the progenies of artificial gynogenetic diploids and found all progenies (n = 160) were females. Meanwhile, around 1 : 1 sex ratio was observed in a total of 579 juvenile offspring from three other families. To further extend the male-specific region, we performed genome walking and got a male-specific sequence of 8,661 bp. Five pairs of primers were designed and could be used to efficiently distinguish males from females in bighead carp and silver carp. The development of these male-specific markers and results of their molecular sexing in different populations provide strong evidence for a sex determination system of female homogametry or male heterogametry (XX/XY) in bighead carp and silver carp. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of effective sex-specific markers in these two large carp species."	"10.1093/dnares/dsx054"	"internal-pdf://3720933053/Liu-2018.pdf"

Three Gorges Dam"	"Hydrodynamic characteristics of spawning grounds are important factors affecting the spawning of four major Chinese carps (Mylopharyngodon piceus, Ctenopharyngodon idella, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, and Aristichthys nobilis). To investigate the relationship between the preferred hydrodynamic characteristics of spawning sites and the response of fish spawning behavior, we monitored the flow field of spawning sites during ecological operation of the Three Gorges Dam (i.e., man-made flood regulation) in 2014 and 2015. We used the data to explore the correlation between vorticity changes in spawning grounds and the spawning amount. Pearson correlation coefficients of the average vorticity in all cross-sections of the Yidu spawning ground and spawning amount in 2014 and 2015 were 0.730 and 0.822, respectively, indicating a significant positive correlation between vorticity and spawning activity. In some specific regions, this correlation was even stronger (Pearson correlations of the regional vorticity and egg production were >0.95). To further corroborate and analyze the relationship between these specific regions and the distribution of broodstock during the breeding season, an ultrasonic telemetry test of broodstock was conducted in the Yidu spawning ground in 2016. The results showed that the broodstocks were concentrated in the reach near the Quantong Pier (~76 km from the Three Gorges Dam). These regions were consistent with areas of river characterized by highly correlated vorticity and egg production levels, suggesting that these regions are areas preferred by four major Chinese carps for spawning."

The river basin of Upper Odra is situated in the area of River Odra springs featuring mostly minor streams which are not currently accessible for the migration of fishes from the lower river parts and from the Baltic Sea because of the existence of tens of migration barriers in the area of Poland. There has been actually proved the occurrence of eight non-native fish species the presence of which is, with the exclusions of Carassius gibelio and Pseudorasbora parva, the result of the planned introduction related to the fish management activities. The River Morava basin consists of two parts – the system of the River Morava itself and the entire River Dyje basin. Currently, there are 16 non-native fish species. Apart from the eight species existing also in the Odra river basin, there are also eight other species the existence of which relates to the migration accessibility from the confluence of these two rivers for fishes from the River Danube through the lower part of the River Morava. The species Lepomis gibbosus, Neogobius melanostomus and Proterorhinchus semilunaris were the last ones which have arrived there by themselves. Coregonus maraena and Coregonus peled are bred in fishponds.The basic part of the non-native fishes’ spectrum existing in free waters of the two basins consists of the species which are bred in aquaculture and fishponds (Oncorhyncus mykiss, Salvelinus fontinalis, Ctenopharyngodon idella, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, and Hypophthalmichthys nobilis). These species, with the exception of Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, introduced also into the fishing grounds and especially Oncorhynchus mykiss and Ctenopharyngodon idella make the important fishes for anglers. Their presence in the waters of the Czech Republic might be considered as beneficial from the economic point of view. From the ecological point of view, the im- portant fact is that they have become very well acclimatised in the local conditions and their natural breeding does not take place and their distribution in water ecosystems, as well as their numbers are fully determined by the management of the Czech Anglers Union. However, Carassius gibelio, Pseudorasbora parva and also Lepomis gibbosus in the River Morava basin have been assessed as distinctly invasive species having more negative impacts on the original ichthyocenosis and biodiversity. Neogobius melanostomus is also potentially dangerous in this basin. In the case of spread of Lepomis gibosus into the River Odra basin, it might become also potentially highly dangerous."

Consequently, Asian carp management plans (including contractual harvest) have been implemented to prevent range expansion into vulnerable systems such as the Great Lakes. Asian carp harvest also provides an opportunity to assess if control efforts can benefit native fishes. To answer this question, 26 years of standardized electrofishing data were analyzed, focusing on gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) body condition (Wr) and abundance (catch-per-unit-effort, CPUE) from the Illinois River (Illinois, USA). Gizzard shad data were categorized into pre-Asian carp establishment (1990–1999), after Asian carp establishment (2000–2009), and harvest (2010–2014) periods. Gizzard shad Wr and small gizzard shad CPUE decreased in the entire river after Asian carp invasion, and Wr and large gizzard shad CPUE rebounded where harvest occurred. Contrastingly, small gizzard CPUE has not yet exhibited a positive response to harvest. These mixed results indicate a time-lag may exist between management action and ecosystem response. Ultimately, Asian carp removal may be facilitating improvements in gizzard shad body condition (by increasing forage availability), which may portend a future gizzard shad population rebound."

Efforts have been made to inhibit Bighead Carp and Silver Carp expansion into the Great Lakes through hydrologically connected systems, but understanding their expansion to and from hydrologically disconnected systems could further reduce this risk. We assessed the origin of 23 Bighead Carp and 1 Silver Carp captured from Chicago Urban Fishing Program ponds using otolith chemistry. Otolith core delta O-18 and delta C-13 of captured Bighead Carp did not overlap with ranges of otolith delta O-18 and delta C-13 from Bighead Carp and Silver Carp from the Illinois River but was consistent with otolith delta O-18 and delta C-13 of Bighead Carp obtained from aquaculture facilities. Likewise, otolith core Sr:Ca of 19 captured Bighead Carp was higher than the range of otolith Sr:Ca from Illinois River Bighead Carp and Silver Carp. Due to inferred timing of introduction (likely age-0 or age-1 fish), these Bighead Carp may have been released incidentally via stocking sport fish shipments contaminated with the carp. Contrastingly, otolith chemistry results suggest that the captured Silver Carp originated from the Illinois River, although timing of introduction of this fish could not be inferred. Overall, our results indicate that nearly all fish analyzed did not originate from rivers within the Mississippi River basin and were instead likely introduced through stocking contaminated shipments of fish. Even though Chicago Urban Fishing Program ponds now pose a minimal threat for Bighead Carp and Silver Carp expansion into Lake Michigan, sustained urban pond monitoring and nonnative fish removal may limit or eliminate this alternative invasion pathway. Additionally, continued vigilance in understanding the origin of stocked fish and culture environment (e.g., polyculture) could decrease the likelihood of future invasive species introductions through contaminated sport fish stockings."

Yangtze River"	"Bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (H. molitrix), collectively called bigheaded carps, are cyprinids native mainly to China and have been introduced to over 70 countries. Paleontological and molecular phylogenetic analyses demonstrate bighead and silver carps originated from the Yangtze‐Huanghe River basins and modern populations may have derived from the secondary contact of geographically isolated fish during the last glacial events. Significant genetic differences are found among populations of native rivers (Yangtze, Pearl, and Amur) as well as introduced/invasive environments (Mississippi R., USA and Danube R., Hungary), suggesting genetic backgrounds and ecological selection may play a role in population differentiation. Population divergence of bighead carp or silver carp has occurred within their native rivers, whereas, within the Mississippi River Basin (MRB)—an introduced region, such genetic differentiation is likely taking place at least in silver carp. Interspecific hybridization between silver and bighead carps is rare within their native regions; however, extensive hybridization is observed in the MRB, which could be contributed by a shift to a more homogenous environment that lacks reproductive isolation barriers for the restriction of gene flow between species. The wild populations of native bighead and silver carps have experienced dramatic declines; in contrast, the introduced bigheaded carps overpopulate the MRB and are considered two invasive species, which strongly suggests fishing capacity (overfishing and underfishing) be a decisive factor for fishery resource exploitation and management. This review provides not only a global perspective of evolutionary history and population divergence of bigheaded carps but also a forum that calls for international research collaborations to deal with critical issues related to native population conservation and invasive species control."

Juveniles were exposed to different concentrations of CAL solutions (0, 100, 300, 500 and 700 mg/L) for different immersion periods (12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hr). Increased glutamate‐oxaloacetate transaminase, glutamate‐pyruvate transaminase and alkaline phosphatases activities were assumed to be due to CAL‐induced hepatic damage, probably because of the high potential of CAL to accumulate in fish hepatopancreas. Higher CAL concentrations (>300 mg/L) and prolonged immersion periods (>48 hr) could lead to greater toxicity in juvenile silver carp and, to a certain degree, damage the gills and hepatopancreas. The antioxidant responses in the gills and hepatopancreas result in successful elimination of the excess CAL‐induced reactive oxygen species for CAL exposure ≤24 hr. Our results confirmed that the toxic effects of CAL on antioxidant enzyme levels and lipid peroxidation in juvenile silver carp depended on both CAL concentrations and duration of exposure. Moreover, concentration of CAL solutions and the immersion period should be, respectively, restricted to ≤300 mg/L and ≤24 hr, when CAL is used for immersion marking juvenile silver carp."

Three Mono Trap RCC18 adsorbents were used to extract samples. Volatile components were analyzed by gas phase-olfaction-mass spectrometry. The main odor-active substances were identified by aroma extraction dilution analysis. The overall odor profile was analyzed by electronic nose. Overall sensory evaluation showed that metallic and grassy in Chinese carp were heavier than those in American. Trimethylamine, ketones, aldehydes, and alcohols were the main odor components in the two species. Flavor dilution factors indicated that hexanal (grassy), 1-octen-3-ol (mushroom-like), and 2,3-pentanedione (milky) were important.

The fact that a species has not yet been assessed or is classified as Data Deficient does not imply that it is not under some level of risk.4 Among the major species produced in global aquaculture, some are Near Threatened, such as the silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), while others are listed in threatened categories, including the striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) and the Japanese sea cucumber (Apostichopus japonicus), both Endangered, and the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and the Chinese softshell turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis), both Vulnerable. [...]many important aquaculture species have not yet been evaluated, and these include: other major carps; salmonids; crustaceans such as whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei), giant tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon) and Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis); molluscs such as Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and Japanese carpet shells (Ruditapes philippinarum); and all the major farmed seaweeds. While aquaculture might not conserve the specific genetic identity of a certain wild stock in the way that a gene bank could (due, for example, to genetic drift or deliberate selection), it is likely that the genes from the source population are retained within the farmed resource overall and thus are not completely lost to aquaculture if the original wild source population is compromised or goes extinct."

A balanced gut microbiota is crucial for growth and health of the host because of its important roles in immune defense, digestion of complex carbohydrates, and production of enterocytes. In our study, the dominant bacterial and cellulolytic bacterial (Clostridium I, Clostridium III, Clostridium XIVab, and Fibrobacter) communities in the contents and mucus of the silver carp gut (foregut, midgut, and hindgut) were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses. The results revealed that the dominant and cellulolytic bacterial communities were significantly different among gut regions as well as in contents and mucus. Bacterial diversity and richness in contents and mucus increased along the gut and were higher in contents than those in local mucus. A sequence analysis of gut samples exhibited the conservative phylotypes of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes. The gut of silver carp harbored an abundance of cellulolytic bacteria, particularly Clostridium XIV ab. The foregut segment had the highest proportions of the four cellulolytic bacteria, followed by the midgut and hindgut. However, the proportions of cellulolytic species in the silver carp gut was much lower than those in the terrestrial vertebrate gastrointestinal tract. We conclude that gut bacteria could help silver carp obtain energy from cyanobacteria, which may be why silver carp can maintain high growth rates during cyanobacterial blooms."

Samples were taken seven times over a 49-d period, and BCC was analyzed by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Results revealed that introduction of C. carpio and H. molitrix had a remarkable impact on the composition of bacterioplankton communities, and the BCC was significantly different between each treatment. Sequencing of DGGE bands revealed that the bacterioplankton community in the different treatment groups was consistent at a taxonomic level, but differed in its abundance. H. molitrix promoted the richness of Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria, while more bands affiliated to Cyanobacteria were detected in C. carpio mesocosms. The redundancy analysis (RDA) result demonstrated that the BCC was closely related to the bottom-up (total phosphorus, chlorophyll a, phytoplankton biomass) and top-down forces (biomass of copepods and cladocera) in C. carpio and control mesocosms, respectively. We found no evidence for top-down regulation of BCC by zooplankton in H. molitrix mesocosms, while grazing by protozoa (heterotrophic nanoflagellates, ciliates) became the major way to regulate BCC. Total bacterioplankton abundances were significantly higher in C. carpio mesocosms because of high nutrient concentration and suspended solids. Our study provided insights into the relationship between fish and bacterioplankton at species level, leading to a deep understanding of the function of the microbial loop and the aquatic ecosystem."

However, there is much to learn about the predator-prey interaction during the switching process. We carried out a series of indoor experiments to examine the predation capacity, predation preference, and growth performance of exotic juvenile LB feeding on candidate prey species in the Pearl River Delta. The widely distributed oriental river prawn (Macrobranchium nipponense), barcheek goby (Ctenogobius giurinus), western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), and mud carp (Cirrhinus molitorella), with relatively similar total lengths, were selected as potential prey based on their availability and habitat use. Our results show that predation capacity and preference varied quantitatively and qualitatively among prey species. The number of oriental river prawns killed was significantly less than that of fish species, comparing the 1st hour with the 24th hour (p < 0.01). The feeding rhythm of LB varied significantly from crayfish to fish. Numerically, Jacobs' selection index reinforced LB's special preference for predating G. affinis. Although there were obvious variations in predation capacity and feed selection, no statistically significant growth differences were detected among LB groups feeding on live M. nipponense, G. affinis, H. molitrix, and C. molitorella (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that the successful ontogenetic dietary shift of juvenile LB may depend on the availability and vulnerability of local fish species. Further study on the reproductive phenology of potential fish prey may help to predict LB's establishment."	"10.3390/life12020295"	"internal-pdf://3437620566/Luo-2022.pdf"

As a typical river-lake migratory fish species, the silver carp habitat selection was determined by its migration preference and genetic features. In this study, 15 microsatellite fluorescent markers combined with capillary electrophoresis were used to analyze the genetic diversity, genetic differentiation, and structure of nature silver carp populations in the Sanzhou (SZ), Hukou (HK), Anqing (AQ), Zhenjiang (ZJ), and Rugao (RG) sections of the Yangtze River. The results showed that 15 microsatellite loci exhibited medium to high polymorphisms. The overall genetic diversity in the Yangtze River was high, with the average value of Shannon's information index ranging from 1.559 to 1.668. The numbers of alleles (Ne) ranged from 1.630 to 10.100. The expected heterozygosity (He, 0.690-0.721) was higher than observed heterozygosity (Ho, 0.598-0.646), and the genetic variation mainly originated from within the population (94.69%). However, the entire population was in the state of heterozygous deletion, and HK, RG populations encountered the risk of inbreeding risk (F > 1). Interestingly, there was a distinct genetic structure for the population in the HK section, which indicated that local population has occurred to the silver carp in this river section, and they may also possess aggregation characteristics specific to the river-lake-connected (RLC) habitat. The results mostly support the conclusion that the RLC habitat is essential for geographic population formation. The potential impact of special habitats on natural populations should be considered, and continuous surveys on population dynamics should be performed."

Linear discriminant analysis models were built for the classification of species. We inspected the effect of partial least square, principal component analysis, competitive adaptive reweighted sampling, and fast Fourier transform on linear discriminant analysis. The results showed that the dimension reduction methods worked very well for this example. Linear discriminant analysis models which were combined with principal component analysis and fast Fourier transform could classify accurately all the samples under multiplicative scatter correction pre-processing. According to the loadings in principal component analysis, spectra wavelengths 1000, 1001, 1154, 1208, 1284, 1288, 1497, 1665, and 1770 nm were selected as effective wavelengths in linear discriminant analysis.

Efforts to control the spread of these invasive species require information on their spatial ecology, though sampling is hindered by their broad extent, habitat tolerances, and species‐specific behaviour. Mobile hydroacoustics was used to quantify habitat and depth use of bigheaded carp over four years in the heavily invaded Lower Illinois River, a major Mississippi tributary and potential dispersal pathway to the Great Lakes. Horizontally oriented transducers (combined with capture gear for species designation) enabled sampling of the main habitat features in this large flood plain river. Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) were dominant over bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) at all but one site, although habitat use was similar for both species. Densities were highest in lotic backwaters, followed by lentic backwaters and nearshore main channel, with lowest densities in the mid main channel. Bigheaded carp size and species composition were independent of habitat type. Depth associations were similar for both species, with average occurrence at 2.5–3.5 m in the main channel and 1–2 m in backwaters. However, depth relative to the river bed was largely similar across habitat types. Bigheaded carp density and depth use in the main channel were linked non‐linearly to river discharge and water temperature, respectively; densities were reduced during high discharge, whereas depth use became shallower at higher temperatures. Density–hydrology trends were less apparent in backwaters. These findings highlight critical aspects of bigheaded carp spatial ecology that will facilitate effective management in invaded and at‐risk ecosystems."

Fish disease outbreak was investigated in a wetland of West Bengal, India to identify the aetiological factors involved. The moribund fish were examined and subjected to bacterial isolation. Two bacterial causative agents were identified as Acinetobacter junii and Acinetobacter pittii by biochemical characterization and 16S rRNA gene amplification. Both the isolates were oxidase‐negative, nitrate‐negative, catalase‐positive and indole‐negative. The molecular identification using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic tree analysis further confirmed the two Acinetobacter spp. with 97%–99% similarity. The antibiotic resistance patterns of these two bacteria revealed that both of them were resistant to β‐lactam, cefalexin, cephalothin, amoxyclav, cefuroxime, cefadroxil, clindamycin, vancomycin and penicillin. In addition, A. pittii was also resistant to other antibiotics of cephams group such as ceftazidime and cefotaxime. In the challenge experiment, both A. junii and A. pittii were found to be pathogenic with LD50 of 1.24 × 105 and 1.88 × 107 cfu/fish respectively. Histopathological examination of gill, liver and kidney revealed prominent changes supporting bacterial septicaemia. The investigation reports for the first time on concurrent infection by A. junii and multidrug‐resistant (MDR)‐A. pittii as emerging fish pathogens to cause severe mortality in Labeo catla and Hypophthalmichthys molitrix in a freshwater wetland."

This study determined the moisture, ash, protein and lipid contents and the fatty acid composition, as well as the nutritional quality of the lipids in fillets of these five freshwater fish species. Moisture was the most prominent fish component (74.7%-81.7%), followed by protein (15.8%-18.8%) and lipids (0.4%-8.2%). Saturated palmitic acid (90-1740 mg/100 g) and monounsaturated oleic acid (70-2260 mg/100 g) were the major fatty acids found in all the fish species. The grass and common carps and Nile tilapia (caged) had high contents of y-linolenic acid (GLA), with an average of 536 mg/100 g. Bighead carp was the richest source of w-3 PUFA, mainly eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 400 mg/100 g) and docosahexaenoic (DHA, 620 mg/100 g) acids, and had the highest ы-3/ы-6 ratio of 6.11. The nutritional evaluation of the fatty acid profile indicated that average values were: atherogenicity index (AI) ~0.59, thrombogenicity index (TI) ~0.82, hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic ratio (H/H ~ 1.98), polyunsaturated/saturated ratio (P/S) ~0.43 and ы-3/ы-6 ratio ~2.18, values suggesting that the consumption of these freshwater fish species could be of benefit to human health.Alternate abstract:Há pouca informaęao disponível sobre a composição química de especies de peixe de água doce (tilápia-do-nilo, carpa-prateada, carpa-cabeça-grande, carpa-capim e carpa-comum) com grande importância comercial e amplamente cultivadas na regiao oeste de Santa Catarina, Brasil. Este estudo teve por objetivo determinar a composição de umidade, cinzas, proteínas, lipídeos e ácidos graxos, bem como a qualidade nutricional dessas cinco especies de peixe de água doce. A umidade foi o componente majoritário nos files de peixe (74,7%-81,7%), seguida de proteína (15,8%-18,8%) e lipídeos (0,4%-8,2%). O ácido palmítico foi o ácido graxo saturado predominante (90-1.740 mg/100 g) e o ácido oleico foi o principal ácido monoinsaturado (70-2.260 mg/100 g) encontrados nos files.

Ukraine is among the 24 countries, whose aquaculture and inland fisheries are currently facing medium stress, and will be potentially under higher stress in the future. The purpose of our work was to find a relation between air temperature and its impact on the spreading of infectious in freshwater aquaculture of Ukraine in the context of global climate change. Material and methods. During 2011-2017, an epizootiological survey on experimental fishery farms of different patterns of ownership was conducted. The objects of research were the clinically healthy and diseased freshwater fish of different age groups, as well as parasites and bacteria of different etiological groups that affect aquatic organisms. A review of the clinical and parasitological study of different age groups and hybrids of silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Valenciennes, 1844) and bighead carp, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis (Richardson, 1845), common carp, Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758, and some cultured rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum, 1792), and brown trout, Salmo trutta Linnaeus, 1758 were conducted. Research methods common for ichthyopathology, microbiology, and fisheries were used. Results. The study on fish diseases was conducted both in aquaculture and natural waters, in particular in the reservoirs of the Dnieper Cascade. Not only the growth and development of fish but also the signs and the course of various diseases appeared to depend on water temperature. The resistance of the fish and other hydrobionts to the influence of threshold temperatures depends on their adaptation to particular factors. In the years with a relatively warm vegetation period, the infection rates significantly increased to 25% and above. A significant broadening of the spectrum of parasitic infections over the last decade has been noted. An ecological misbalance in the ecosystems, an increase in the level of organic pollution of water, and, as a result, in the number of pathogenic microorganisms that may be harmful to fish and human health were registered. Conclusion. Taking into account the results of the analytical studies regarding climate change in Ukraine, we can predict outbreaks of bacterial and parasitic diseases in fish in the years to come, which may cause significant economic damage to aquaculture farms."

Ingestion is a vital pathway for PFASs to transmit to humans especially through water and fish. In present study, PFASs in water and fish from the drinking water source of Beijing in China were investigated. Three layers of water were collected in order to find the connection between concentrations of PFASs and depth of water, which showed no prominent correlation. PFASs in water from Miyun Reservoir with concentrations of 5.30-8.50 ng/L, were relatively lower compared with other reports on raw drinking water. Perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were the dominant PFASs. In addition, six species of fish (including Cyprinus carpio, Carassius auratus, Erythroculter dabryi, Pseudohemiculter dispar, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Siniperca chuatsi) were analyzed, with concentrations of PFASs ranging from 1.70 to 14.32 ng/g wet weight (w.w.). Due to relatively stronger bioaccumulation potential, long chain perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs) and perfluorinated sulfonates (PFSAs) were detected with higher concentrations, especially perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUdA) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA). The estimated daily intake (EDI) of PFASs through drinking water and fish consumption were 0.20-0.34 and 3.44-12.61 ng/kg bw/day based on Exposure Factors Handbook of Chinese Population, respectively. In addition, the EDI of high priority concern PFASs via pork, chicken and dust were also calculated, with value of 0.015-0.043, 0.003-0.013 and 0.074-0.390 ng/kg bw/day, respectively. The total EDI of PFOS and PFOA via diverse pathways were less than suggested tolerable daily intake (PFOS, 150 ng/kg bw/day; PFOA, 1500 ng/kg bw/day), indicating that the detected levels would not cause severe health effects on Beijing residents."

Distinct niches of these two species lead to differences in their ecological function. Here, high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene was employed to investigate and compare the bacterial community and potential function of silver carp and bighead carp reared in aquaculture pond systems. We found no significant difference in alpha diversity between microbial community of water body and intestinal microbiota of silver carp and bighead carp. Bacterial community richness of bighead carp, however, was higher than that of silver carp. A significant separation between microbial community of water body and of two fish species was observed. The Norank_o_PeM15, norank_f_Alcaligenaceae and unclassified_p_Firmicutes were higher for bighead carp but only Pseudomonas was higher for silver carp. Compared with bighead carp, intestinal microbiota of silver carp also had less typical planktonic bacteria. A separation but non-significant of bacterial community between silver carp and bighead carp was observed. In terms of predicted community function for water body, except for the lower abundance of cell motility than silver carp, the other pathways were generally more enriched than the two fish species. For the comparison between silver carp and bighead carp, most metabolic pathways, e.g., nutrients transport and metabolism, were generally more enriched for silver carp. The results of this study gain a better appreciation of gut microbiome ecology relating to pond culture of two species of microphagic filter feeding carps, which could be effectively used in the management of these two species to enhance production and health."

These data come from survey or monitoring efforts that use a wide variety of tools. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a surveillance tool that uses genetic markers for detecting species and holds potential as a tool for large-scale monitoring programs. Two challenges of eDNA-based studies are uncertainties created by imperfect capture of eDNA in collection samples (e.g., water field samples) and imperfect detection of eDNA using molecular methods (e.g., quantitative PCR). Occurrence models can be used to address these challenges, thus we use an occurrence model to address two objectives: first, to determine how many samples were required to detect species using eDNA; second, to examine when and where to take samples. We collected water samples from three different habitat types in the Upper Mississippi River when both Bighead Carp and Silver Carp were known to be present based on telemetry detections. Each habitat type (backwater, tributary, and impoundment) was sampled during April, May, and November. Detections of eDNA for both species varied across sites and months, but were generally low, 0-19.3% of samples were positive for eDNA. Overall, we found that eDNA-based sampling holds promise to be a powerful monitoring tool for resource managers; however, limitations of eDNA-based sampling include different biological and ecological characteristics of target species such as seasonal habitat usage patterns as well as aspects of different physical environments that impact the implementation of these methods such as water temperature."

The research was performed in two different ponds, with an area of 0.45 ha each. The first pond (PCP -polyculture carp pond) was used for rearing in polyculture common carp (Cyprinus carpio) with grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). The second pond was divided by using a net, and stocked as follows: first part with an area of 0.15 ha (CP - with common carp pond) and the second part with an area of 0.30 ha (PP - polyculture pond). Cyanobacterial, total chlorophyll "a" concentration and also turbidity 24 hours kinetic were determined in nine sampling points, as follows: inlet and outlet channels, inlet and outlet area of each pond (PCP, CP and PP) and also the middle area of PCP pond. The maximum concentrations of cyanobacterial chlorophyll "a" were recorded between 22.87-86.80 |jg L-1 at 14:00 o'clock and the minimum concentration between 13.87-58.70 jg L-1 at 02:00 o'clock. The maximum concentration of total chlorophyll "a" was recorded during the dawn (08:00 am), between 145.63-216.57 jg L-1, while the minimum values were encountered during the night (02:00 am), between 71.97-123.03 jg L-1. Significant high cyanobacterial and total chlorophyll "a" concentrations during the day period, compared with night period are recorded only in case of classical cyprinides polyculture pond production system (PCP).

The presence of these alien species and their hybrids in Hungarian natural water bodies may pose significant ecological risks (connected with their phytoplankton and zooplankton consumption). To be able to deal with the ecological risks and to understand the potential of invasiveness of these species, one must have information on the population-level genetic structures of these alien fish stocks. Ten microsatellite DNA markers and one mitochondrial marker were used to address these questions. The results showed that the two stocks are genetically different; the lake population was genetically more diverse and consisted of hybrid and silver carp individuals, while the river population contained only silver carps. The mitochondrial sequences found in the two populations originated from the Yangtze River. Based on the different genetic structures of the stocks, one can assume that bigheaded carps do not reproduce in Lake Balaton, while the Tisza River stock represents significant reproductive potential and may become invasive in this river. Bigheaded carps (bighead carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, and silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and their hybrids play an important ecological and economic role in their original habitat, while their introduced stocks may pose serious ecological risks. To address questions about the persistence and invasiveness of these fish, we need to better understand their population structures. The genetic structures of bigheaded carp populations inhabiting Lake Balaton and the Tisza River were examined with ten microsatellite markers and a mitochondrial DNA marker (COI). The Lake Balaton stock showed higher genetic diversity compared with the Tisza River stock. Based on hierarchical clustering, the Tisza population was characterized only by only silver carps, while the Balaton stock included hybrid and silver carp individuals. All COI haplotypes originated from the Yangtze River. Based on the high genomic and mitochondrial diversity, along with the significant deviation from H-W equilibrium and the lack of evidence of bottleneck effect, it can be assumed that bigheaded carps do not reproduce in Lake Balaton. The present stock in Balaton may have originated from repeated introductions and escapes from the surrounding fishponds. The Tisza stock consists solely of silver carp individuals. This stock appears to have significant reproductive potential and may become invasive if environmental factors change due to climate change."

Lake Balaton"	"Planktivorous silver carp and bighead carp (collectively, the bigheaded carps) have been stocked worldwide and their invasion has caused severe impacts on many freshwater ecosystems. Exploiting the chance provided by the specific hybrid bigheaded carp stock in Lake Balaton (Hungary) covering the entire morphological range between the two species (including gill raker morphology), we implemented a comprehensive study (1) to reveal the feeding habits of hybrid bigheaded carps living in a mesotrophic, lacustrine habitat and (2) to assess how biotic and abiotic environmental factors and gill raker morphology affect diet composition. We found that all bigheaded carps utilized primarily zooplankton and neglected the scarce and inefficiently digestible phytoplankton, irrespective of gill raker morphology. Moreover, we observed strikingly high levels of inorganic debris consumption, but the proportion of inorganic matter in the guts was not associated directly with the concentration of suspended inorganic particles. Variance in the diet composition of bigheaded carps was related mostly to environmental factors, including the wind-induced resuspension of inorganic particles and seasonally variable availability of food resources. In conclusion, the effects of abiotic environmental factors and available food resources could overwhelm the effect of gill raker morphology in shaping the feeding habits of bigheaded carps."

A pond (10 m × 5 m × 1.2 m) was divided in half by a concrete‐block barrier with a channel (1 m across) allowing fish access to each side. Underwater speakers were placed on each side of the barrier opening, and an outboard motor noise (broadband sound; 0.06–10 kHz) was broadcast to repel carp that approached within 1 m of the channel. Broadband sound was effective at reducing the number of successful crossings in schools of silver carp, bighead carp and a combined school. Repulsion rates were 82.5% (silver carp), 93.7% (bighead carp) and 90.5% (combined). This study demonstrates that broadband sound is effective in deterring carp and could be used as a deterrent in an integrated pest management system."

Previous studies have demonstrated that bighead and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and H. molitrix, respectively) display negative phonotaxis to playbacks of broadband sound recordings produced from a 100 hp outboard boat motor. However. there is concern that acoustic deterrents may impact the movement of non-target native fishes in the Upper Mississippi River. We evaluated the potential impacts of a broadband underwater acoustic deterrent on native ostariophysans [bigmouth buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas)], invasive ostariophysans [bighead carp, common carp (Cyprinus carpio), grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) and silver carp], and native non-ostariophysans [(American eel (Anguilla rostrata), gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), hybrid striped bass (M. saxatilis x M. chrysops), lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) and paddlefish (Polyodon spathula)]. Fish were exposed to playback of the broadband sound (60-10000 Hz), and their behavior was evaluated. Bighead carp showed a strong negative phonotaxis response to the stimulus [12.3 +/- 7.5 (SD) mean consecutive reactions]. silver carp and grass carp showed moderate responses (4.5 +/- 5.2 and 3.8 +/- 3.5 reactions), and common carp displayed low responses (1.3 +/- 1.9 reactions). Of the native fish bigmouth buffalo (2.1 +/- 2.9 reactions) and hybrid striped bass (0.3 +/- 0.5 reactions) were the only species to demonstrate observable response to the acoustic stimulus. Based on this small-scale behavioral screening, acoustic deterrents should have minimal impact on native species, however, larger pond and field trials are necessary to confirm this finding."

[...]cyanobacteria species become phytoplankton dominants, and since they are less edible for zooplankton, this can diminish energy flow to higher trophic levels (Elliott 2012).

Methods: Silver carp meat batters were prepared with 0.5, 1 (reduced-salt) and 2 % (regular salt), and sonicated (20 KHz, 500 W) for 30 and 40 min, or unsonicated (control). Changes in gel properties were evaluated in terms of color, texture, cooking loss and microstructure using color measurement, puncture test, cooking loss and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis, respectively. Results: Ultrasound and salt exposure led to marked effects on color, texture and cooking loss in fish meat gels (p < 0.05). Reduction in salt content increased the lightness (L*) and cooking loss; and also decreased the sample values of greenness (-a*), breaking force, rupture distance and gel strength. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on regular-salt level samples showed that ultrasonic exposure decreased dense aggregates and increased the number and distribution of small cavity samples. Reduced-salt samples (1 % salt) subjected to 30 min sonication had better color (lighter) than control (0 min sonication), better texture (higher gel strength) and cooking loss comparable to that of regular-salt level sample subjected to 30 min sonication, and similar to microstructures from normal salt samples without ultrasound exposure. Conclusion: Low frequency ultrasound is suitable for preparing reduced-salt fish meat gels under suitable ultrasonic conditions."

Hypophthalmichthys molitrix"	"Invasive silver (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead (H. nobilis) carp, collectively referred to as bigheaded carps, threaten aquatic ecosystems of the Upper Midwestern USA. Due to the extensive ecological impacts associated with these species, prevention of their further range expansion is the aim for fisheries management. Recent behavioral studies indicate bigheaded carps are deterred by acoustic barriers and exhibit negative phonotaxis in response to anthropogenic sound sources (≥ 150 dB re 1 μPa). However, the impact of long-term exposure to these sounds on the hearing capabilities of bigheaded carps has not been well documented. In this study, the auditory evoked potential (AEP) technique was used to determine auditory thresholds among bigheaded carps before and after exposure to high intensity (155.7 ± 4.7 dB re 1 μPa SPLrms; − 8.0 ± 4.7 dB re 1 ms−2 PALrms; mean ± SD) broadband sound. Fish were exposed to sound for 30 min or 24 h and AEP measurements were taken at three time points: immediately after exposure, 48 h, or 96 h later. Results indicate that silver and bighead carp experience temporary threshold shifts (TTSs) in frequency detection following sound exposure with the magnitude and length of TTS correlated with exposure duration. The findings from this study will be used to increase the long-term efficacy of acoustical deterrent measures aimed at preventing further range expansion of bigheaded carps."

The treatments were packed in heat-resistant glass after pasteurization. Samples were stored at 4oC for 40 days.The amount of TVB-N in the experimental treatments during the course of the change was increased that this factor varied between 15.25-31.25 mg/100 g of meat in experimental treatments. This factor was in the 100% rolled silver carp treatment until the end of the shelf life in the standard range. The amount of tybarbibacteric acid increased during storage period varied between 0.13-2.11mg malondialdehyde/1000g in experimental treatments, but this factor was in the 100% treatment of silver carp paste after the end of the maintenance period in the standard range (less than 1.8 mg/100gr), in other treatments, after 30 days, was more than standard limitation. The pH changes in treatments did not significantly decrease (P>0.05), this factor varied between 5.05 to 5.93 in the experimental period.

There is concern that Silver Carp may influence phytoplankton community structure with cascading effects on other trophic levels. Information is needed regarding Silver Carp phytoplankton-consumption rates and prey selection to assess their potential impact on the food-web in the river. We investigated Silver Carp diets in a backwater lake of the Lower Mississippi River in order to quantify phytoplankton prey selectivity. We made measurements on 4 dates over a 2-y period, which spanned a range of hydrologic connectivity between the lake and the river and a variety of fish sizes. We quantified selection by comparing phytoplankton community composition in the lake to prey in foreguts of captured Silver Carp using Vanderploeg and Scavia's (1979) relativized selection index. With a possible exception of diatoms on 1 date, there was no relationship of sample date or fish size on prey selection. However, there was a consistent pattern in prey selection: euglenoid algae were positively selected, selection of colonial algae and diatoms was variable, and flagellates and filamentous cyanobacteria were negatively selected. Results are discussed in the context of a conceptual model for Silver Carp phytoplanktivory that incorporates the roles of habitat selection, prey availability, prey capture and processing, and digestive physiology."

In this study, we explored seasonal abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes and bacterial community composition in the water column of an intensive aquaculture pond stocked with Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) prophylactically treated with sulfamethoprim (25% sulfadiazine; 5% trimethoprim), relative to an adjacent unstocked reservoir. Bacterial community composition was monitored using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons in eight sampling profiles to determine seasonal dynamics, representing principal stages in the fish fattening cycle. In tandem, qPCR was applied to assess relative abundance of selected antimicrobial resistance genes (sul1, sul2, dfrA1, tetA and blaTEM) and class-1 integrons (int1). Concomitantly, resistomes were extrapolated from shotgun metagenomes in representative profiles. Analyses revealed increased relative abundance of sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance genes in fishpond-03, relative to pre-stocking and reservoir levels, whereas no significant differences were observed for genes encoding resistance to antimicrobials that were not used in the fishpond-03. Seasons strongly dictated bacterial community composition, with high abundance of cyanobacteria in summer and increased relative abundance of Flavobacterium in the winter. Our results indicate that prophylactic use of sulfonamides in intensive aquaculture ponds facilitates resistance suggesting that prophylactic use of these antimicrobials in aquaculture should be restricted."

In North America, they are typically referred to collectively as “Asian carp,” a reference to their native range. The category “Asian carp” fails to acknowledge the cultural value and the ecological differences of these fishes, causes confusion when translated into Chinese, and frequently causes communication problems with the public and occasionally among professionals when some species are intentionally or inadvertently included or excluded when referred to collectively. Herein, we review the long history of aquaculture of these species in China, their human cultural significance, the origin of the category “Asian carp,” and the problems the term “Asian carp” might cause when used in cross‐cultural communication. We recommend discontinuing the use of this term and replacing it with individual species names. When a group term is required, there are several more favorable alternatives, including existing Chinese terms that have been used for centuries."

During the initial years of the invasion, concurrent declines in the body condition and the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of planktivorous Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum and Bigmouth Buffalo Ictiobus cyprinellus were attributed to competition with Asian carp. Using an additional seven years of data (2007–2013), we assessed whether Silver Carp have continued to exert adverse pressure on the condition, CPUE, and biomass of native planktivores or whether there is evidence of a potential rebound in the populations of native planktivores. The extended data set reaffirms the body condition and the CPUE of Bigmouth Buffalo remain significantly reduced. However, unlike previous analyses, we also observed significant reductions in the CPUE of Gizzard Shad. Additionally, new results show that the CPUE and biomass of Bigmouth Buffalo were more inversely related to Silver Carp CPUE and biomass relative to the CPUE and biomass of Gizzard Shad. These results reinforce that Silver Carp likely suppress native planktivores and also suggest that diet and other life-history traits may explain some of the subtle differences in species-specific responses. Our results also emphasize that long-term data can be critical to understanding how non-native species can influence native fish population dynamics and how this influence may change over time."

For our study, two fishponds with an area of 0.45 ha each and an average water depth of 1.5 m, were used. The first pond (PCP) was used for rearing polyculture common carp (Cyprinus carpio) with grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). The second pond was divided by using a net, as follows: first part with an area of 0.15 ha CP (carp pond - common carp) and the second part with an area of 0.30 ha PP (polyculture pond - common carp, grass carp, bighead carp and silver carp). The experimental research has lasted for 83 days from 15 June to 5 September 2016. During this experimental period, three intermediary biometric and biomass measurements were made, respectively intermediary 1 (6 July 2016), intermediary 2 (25 July 2016) and intermediary 3 (5 August 2016), except initial (15 June 2016) and harvesting (5 September 2016) biometric measurements. The best feed conversion ratio (FCR) value was recorded in case of CP-PP experimental variant (0.59), while CP registered the highest FCR value (1.35). In case of CP, the FCR evolution had an upward tendency until final harvesting, starting from 0.48; 1.61 and ending to 1.99, while in case of PCP, the upward tendency of FCR from 0.53 to 1.44 is followed by a decrease to 1.07, registered at intermediary 3. Specific growth rate (SGR) had a downward tendency during the experimental period in case of common carp and grass carp, while the small upward tendency was observed in certain experimental stages, in case of silver carp and bighead carp. The average of protein efficiency ratio (PER) during the experimental period registered a value of 2.56 in case of PCP, 2.64 for CP and 6.06 for CP-PP. Our study had demonstrated that an IMTA cyprinides pond production system, were common carp is considered as main essential species, can be more sustainable, comparing with a classical polyculture cyprinides pond production system. In terms of common carp growth performance and total cyprinides biomass production, PCP production system registered the best results, compared with the IMTA system (CP-PP).

We used Mississippi River Basin fish community data collected by the Long Term Resource Monitoring program and the Missouri Department of Conservation to evaluate possible interaction between Asian Carp and native fishes. Results from two decades of long-term monitoring throughout much of the Mississippi River suggest that Silver Carp relative abundance has increased while relative abundance (Bigmouth Buffalo [F (3, 8240) = 6.44, P<0.01] and Gizzard Shad [F (3, 8240) = 31.04, P<0.01]) and condition (Bigmouth Buffalo [slope = -0.11; t = -1.71; P = 0.1014] and Gizzard Shad [slope = -0.39; t = -3.02; P = 0.0073]) of native planktivores have declined. Floodplain lake qualitative evaluations yielded similar results; floodplain lake fish communities were likely altered (i.e., reductions in native species) by Silver Carp. Furthermore, laboratory experiments corroborated field evidence; Silver Carp negatively influence native planktivores through competition for prey (all comparisons, P > 0.05). To this end, this study provides evidence that Silver Carp are likely adversely influencing native fishes; however, mere presence of Silver Carp in the system does not induce deleterious effects on native fishes. To the best of our knowledge, this evaluation is the first to describe the effects of Asian Carp throughout the Mississippi River Basin and could be used to reduce the effects of Asian Carp on native biota through an integrated pest management program as suggested by congressional policy. Despite the simplicity of the data analyzed and approach used, this study provides a framework for beginning to identify the interactions of invasive fish pests on native fishes (i.e., necessary first step of integrated pest management). However, knowledge gaps remain. We suggest future efforts should conduct more in depth analyses (i.e., multivariate statistical approaches) that investigate the influence on all native species."

Hypophthalmichthys molitrix"	"The development of regenerative medicine turns attention toward native collagen as a biocompatible material. Particularly interesting is fish skin collagen, which is relatively easy to extract comparing mammalian tissues and free of some pathogens that are dangerous to humans. The paper presents results of IR Raman spectroscopy studies of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) skin collagen. As collagen properties result from its structure and conformation, both sensitive to temperature, FT NIR Raman spectroscopy is an excellent tool to characterize the molecular structure of fish skin collagen, particularly in temperature range typical for the manufacturing processes of biomedical products. Therefore, the Raman spectra were recorded in a temperature range of 300 to 403 K. The analysis of Raman spectra of prepared collagen films, particularly in the range of the bands related to amide I and amide III entities, showed a high content of α-helix and α-helix type molecular organization in fish skin collagen. Additionally, the secondary structure of the studied fish skin collagen is stable up to ~358 K. Heating to 403 K leads to irreversible changes in the molecular structure of fish skin collagen. It was found that the Raman spectrum of fish skin collagen preheated in this manner becomes similar to the spectrum of the collagen obtained from bovine Achilles tendon, whose secondary structure does not change up to 403 K."

However, the virus has also been detected in a few non-tilapines. As tilapia is generally farmed in polyculture systems along with carps in South Asian countries, there is a likelihood that TiLV-infected tilapia can transmit the virus to the co-cultured species. In view of the above, the susceptibility of three carp species, namely catla (Catla catla), mrigal (Cirrhinus mrigala) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) was evaluated vis-a-vis tilapia, following experimental infection with TiLV. No clinical signs and histopathological alterations could be observed in carps. RT-qPCR revealed that TiLV copy numbers in liver and brain of all the three carps were almost negligible and did not show any increase with time, suggesting that the virus did not replicate in liver and brain, the target organs of TiLV. Further, TiLV could not be isolated from pooled liver and brain tissues of carps using permissive CFF cell line. On the contrary, in tilapia, typical clinical signs and histopathological lesions were observed and there was significant increase in TiLV copy number up to 6 days post-injection. Furthermore, the virus was successfully isolated from pooled liver and brain tissue of infected tilapia. From the above findings, it could be concluded that C. catla, C. mrigala and H. molitrix are resistant to TiLV infection and unlikely to be carriers for this virus."

Hypophthalmichthys molitrix"	"Unregulated rivers provide unobstructed corridors for the dispersal of both native and invasive species. We sought to evaluate range size and habitat use of an invasive species (Silver Carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) in an unimpounded river reach (Wabash River, IN), to provide insights into the dispersal of invasive species and their potential overlap with native species. We hypothesized that range size would increase with fish length, be similar among sexes, and vary annually while habitats used would be deeper, warmer, lower velocity, and of finer substrate. Silver Carp habitat use supported our hypotheses but range size did not vary with sex or length. 75% home range varied annually, suggesting that core areas occupied by individuals may change relative to climate-based factors (e.g., water levels), whereas broader estimates of range size remained constant across years. Ranges were often centered on landscape features such as tributaries and backwaters. Results of this study indicate habitat and landscape features as potential areas where Silver Carp impacts on native ecosystems may be the greatest. Observed distribution of range sizes indicates the presence of sedentary and mobile individuals within the population. Mobile individuals may be of particular importance as they drive the spread of the invasive species into new habitats."	"10.1007/s10750-017-3296-y"	"internal-pdf://2398257485/Prechtel-2018.pdf"

Little is known about the assimilation of natural food resources into fish. In order to elucidate the food web and nitrogen flows in a traditionally and a semi-intensively managed pond in Vietnam, delta super(13)C and delta super(15)N in pond inputs and fish were measured before and after the application of inorganic super(15)N at 1.1 and 0.4 % of total nitrogen. The applied super(15)N was traced through the biomass of stocked fish over 30 days. Under traditional management, grass carp was the dominant species in number and biomass. After 30 days, grass carp assimilated 1.2 % of the applied tracer through natural food resources. Filter feeders assimilated only 0.1-0.3 % of the tracer after 30 days because of the limited productivity in the traditionally managed pond. Nile tilapia showed the highest uptake rates over the 30 days, which demonstrated their ability to feed on a variety of natural food resources. In total, 2.6 % of the applied super(15)N was assimilated into fish biomass after 30 days. Under semi-intensive management, common carp was the main species numerically and assimilated 1.8 % of the tracer after 30 days. Grass carp was stocked at lower density, but had the highest biomass by the time of the experiment. Grass carp assimilated 0.2 % of the applied tracer suggesting a low contribution of natural food resources to its nutrition. Silver carp benefited most from the higher natural food resources. In total, 4.1 % of applied super(15)N was assimilated into fish biomass after 30 days. Traditional small-scale aquaculture of a grass carp-dominated polyculture has a lower assimilation efficiency of applied fertilizers into fish biomass than a common carp-dominated polyculture under semi-intensive management."

One method is the development and use of biocides. Identifying new chemicals as part of the biocide registration approval process can require screening millions of compounds. Traditionally, screening new chemicals has been done in vivo using test. organisms. Using in vitro (e.g., cell lines) and in silico (e.g., computer models) methods decrease test organism requirements and increase screening speed and efficiency. These methods, however, would be greatly improved by better understanding how individual fish species metabolize selected compounds. We combined cell assays and metabolomics to create a powerful tool to facilitate the identification of new control chemicals. Specifically, we exposed cell lines established from bighead carp and silver carp larvae to thiram (7 concentrations) then completed metabolite profiling to assess the dose-response of the bighead carp and silver carp metabolome to thiram. Forty one of the 700 metabolomic markers identified in bighead carp exhibited a dose-response to thiram exposure compared to silver carp in which 205 of 1590 metabolomic markers exhibited a dose-response. Additionally, we identified 11 statistically significant metabolomic markers based upon volcano plot analysis common between both species. This smaller subset of metabolites formed a thiram-specific metabolomic fingerprint which allowed for the creation of a toxicant specific, rather than a species-specific, metabolomic fingerprint. Metabolomic fingerprints may be used in biocide development and improve our understanding of ecologically significant events, such as mass fish kills. Published by Elsevier Ltd."

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the suitability of cryopreservation protocols and the effectiveness of ultrasound for silver carp embryos. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Embryos at three developmental stages were exposed to 10, 15, 20, and 25% of five cryoprotectants (CPAs), namely propylene glycol (PG), dimethylformamide (DFA), DMSO, Me0H, and ethylene glycol (EG) for 20 min. Embryos were exposed to twelve vitrification solutions (VSs) for 10 (five steps of 2 min), 15 (five steps of 3 min), 20 (five steps of 4 min) min. Embryos were also exposed to ultrasound in VSs prior to cooling for cryopreservation. RESULTS: Hatching rates decreased with increasing CPA concentrations while toxicity varied in the order of PG < DMSO < EG < MeOH < DFA. Tail elongation stage was more tolerant to CPA than 6-somites and morula stages. The survival of embryos exposed to ultrasound in VS was remarkably lower than in water. Embryos exposed to ultrasound in VSs under the best conditions did not response well after attempted vitrification.

Hypophthalmichthys molitrix"	"An experiment was performed to evaluate the effects of different drying methods with different pre-treatments on the physico-chemical, microbiological, and sensory properties of the silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix. In order to achieve this objective, the collected fresh fish were dried using traditional (without any pre-treatment), improved (fish soaked in a 5% salt solution for 10 min and then treated with chili powder (0.3%) and turmeric powder (0.3%)), and solar tunnel (fish soaked in a 5% salt solution for 10 min) drying methods. The results showed that the dried fish produced by the solar tunnel drying method were rehydrated more rapidly than the products produced by the traditional and improved drying methods. The moisture content of the dried H. molitrix was varied from 18.24 to 25.43% on a fresh matter basis. There was no significant (p > 0.05) difference found regarding the protein, lipid, and ash content among the different drying methods on a dry matter basis. The total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N) contents ranged between 37.58 and 45.03 mg/100 g, and significantly (p < 0.05) the lowest TVB-N was observed in dried fish produced by the solar tunnel drying method. Moreover, the highest peroxide and acid values were found in the traditionally produced dried fish as compared with the fish dried by the improved and solar tunnel drying methods. The aerobic plate count of dried fish ranged from 4.52 to 7.51 log CFU/g. The sensory evaluation results revealed that the solar-dried products showed superior quality than the products produced by the traditional and improved drying methods. The results revealed that the dried fish produced by the solar tunnel drying method provided the best product in terms of physico-chemical, microbiological, and sensory aspects."

There are numerous fish species and due to their close resemblance with each other, it is difficult to classify them by external characters. Recently, computer vision and deep learning-based identification of different animal species is being widely used by the researchers. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most analytically powerful tools in deep learning architecture for the image classification based on visual features. This work aims to propose a deep learning framework based on the CNN method for fish species identification. The proposed CNN architecture contains 32 deep layers that are considerably deep to derive valuable and discriminating features from the image. The deep supervision is inflicted on the VGGNet architecture to increase the classification performance by instantly adding four convolutional layers to the training of each level in the network. To test the performance of proposed 32-Layer CNN architecture, we developed a dataset termed as Fish-Pak and is publicly available at Mendeley data (Fish-Pak: https://doi.org/10.17632/n3ydw29sbz.3#folder-6b024354-bae3-460a-a758-352685ba0e38) . Fish-Pak contains 915 images with six distinct classes; Ctenopharyngodon idella (Grass carp), Cyprinus carpio (Common carp), Cirrhinus mrigala (Mori), Labeo rohita (Rohu), Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Silver carp), and Catla catla (Thala) and three different image views (head region, body shape, and scale). To ensure the superior performance of proposed CNN architecture, we have carried out the experimental comparison with other deep learning frameworks involving VGG-16 for transfer learning, one block VGG, two block VGG, three block VGG, LeNet-5, AlexNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet-50 on the Fish-Pak data set. Comprehensive empirical analyses reveal that the proposed method achieves state of the art performance and outperforms existing methods."

Extraction and detection of MC-LR from the water and fish samples was conducted by the SPE and HPLC-UV apparatus. Our results showed that among toxic cyanobacteria, Anabaena was the dominant genera during the study period. The results indicated that MC-LR content in water ranged from 0.18 to 3.02 mu g/L in dissolved fraction and undetectable level to 1.13 mu g/L in cellular fraction, in all three seasons. The results of PCA revealed that the environmental parameters including EC, Chl-a, PO43-, pH and temperature were the most effective factors influencing the MC-LR production. Results further showed the mean concentration of MC-LR in muscle and liver of silver carp ranged from 10.12 to 40.98 and from undetectable to 44.34 mu g/kg w.w, respectively. The mean concentration of MC-LR in northern pike was 15.18 to 35.1 mu g/kg w.w in muscle and undetectable to 51.91 mu g/kg w.w in liver samples. Our results suggest that consumption of fish harvested from the Anzali wetland seems to be unsafe for humans, based on obtained estimated daily intake values which were higher than the tolerable daily intake value recommended by WHO. In addition, bioaccumulation factor of MC-LR in edible tissues of fish was estimated based on lipid normalization. The results showed that the BAF of MC-LR in silver carp (1047 +/- 185 L/kg of lipid) was lower than the northern pike (1272 +/- 185 L/kg of lipid), although the difference was not significant.

Fish subsequently escaped, and by the 1980s bigheaded carps were widespread and established in the upper Mississippi River, lower Missouri River, and the Ohio River and some of its tributaries. We sampled bigheaded carps in the lowermost reservoirs on the Tennessee River (Kentucky Lake) and Cumberland River (Lake Barkley) in 2015 and 2016 using multiple gears, including gill nets, hoop nets, electrofishing, and cast nets, to describe their distribution and estimate several population attributes. Additional electrofishing samples on the Duck River, a system renowned for its diverse ichthyofauna and mussel communities, revealed that Silver Carp range extends 220 river kilometers (rkm) upstream below the Columbia Dam. We collected a total of 737 Silver Carp and 10 Bighead Carp through the course of this study. The maximum total lengths and ages were 1385 mm and 22 years for Bighead Carp and 1005 mm and 13 years for Silver Carp. The Silver Carp populations in both reservoirs had the same pattern of strong year classes (2010, 2011, 2012, and 2015) and similar growth rates, which were faster than what has been reported for other populations around the globe.

The paupier sampled the upper water column (1.5 m) in three locations (Kentucky Lake, Kentucky [two embayments]; Lake Barkley, Kentucky [forebay]; and upper Illinois River, Illinois [two backwaters]). Sampling commenced 2 h prior to sunset and continued into the night, not exceeding 5 h beyond sunset. Model selection showed that all temporal and spatial factors were important. Post hoc analysis revealed that Silver Carp CPUE was higher at night (beyond 1 h after sunset), in shoreline habitat, and in water generally no deeper than 5 m. Seasonal variation in CPUE occurred, but in general the CPUE was high in the fall for all locations. Considering these results for management application, we estimated the sampling effort required to reach precise CPUE and adequately assess size structure (125 stock-length fish) in shoreline habitat at night. These sampling objectives were attainable in the spring and fall seasons for all locations (4-31 deployments) but were more variable in summer. We recommend consideration of the paupier as a standard method to sample Silver Carp in large lentic habitats by using the guidelines provided herein (i.e., sampling of the shoreline beyond 1 h after sunset during the fall season). An important next step to strengthen this method is to validate CPUE as an index of density."	"10.1002/nafm.10467"	"internal-pdf://2454448056/Ridgway-2020.pdf"

Increasing evidence suggests harmful impacts of BHC on native fisheries (e.g., competition). Monitoring the abundance of BHC is difficult with traditional fisheries gears, and few studies have evaluated early life stage sampling. Identifying the spawning locations of BHC through early life stage sampling has the ability to enhance management efforts by applying focus to areas that have potential to serve as population sources. We evaluated the performance of three gears in sampling larval BHC and native taxa within large‐river tributaries in terms of abundance, community assemblage, and size structure. We sampled ichthyoplankton in tributaries with active (push net) and passive (drift net, light trap) gears from March through September 2016. Relative abundance of BHC was greatest in push nets followed by drift nets and was lowest in light traps. Native cyprinids and catostomids as well as BHC comprised a large portion of the total catch. Environmental and habitat characteristics (stream velocity, dissolved oxygen, and temperature) related to BHC reproduction influenced each gear’s ability to capture larval BHC, although relationships in final models were not significant. Taxonomic size selectivity existed among gears; in particular, larger BHC were collected in push nets relative to the other gears. Push nets were the most effective in sampling BHC, and remaining gears exhibited unique strengths. Although less effective than active push nets, drift nets proved useful for monitoring BHC in tributaries and may be advantageous in shallow systems with adequate flow. Light traps were ineffective at capturing BHC larvae in tributaries but may offer utility in lentic habitats or for native cyprinids. Our comparison serves as a guide for monitoring larval BHC in their invaded range and for detection in new areas, such as tributaries of the Great Lakes."

We used the Ecopath with Ecosim model framework to evaluate potential risk of BHC population growth and food web effects in four Great Lakes habitats, including mesotrophic waters of Saginaw Bay (Lake Huron) and Lake Erie and the oligotrophic main basins of Lakes Michigan and Huron. We simulated BHC population growth and food web effects under different scenarios of BHC production rates, prey vulnerability to BHCs, and availability of age-0 BHCs to predation by salmonines. In the main basins of Lakes Michigan and Huron, the projected BHC population growth was low or negative, with a projected final BHC biomass of 0.5-1.1 times the initial introductory biomass (2% of total fish biomass for each BHC species), and BHCs had negligible effects on most food web groups across all scenarios. In contrast, in Saginaw Bay and Lake Erie, the projected BHC biomass was 2.5-12.5 times higher than the initial biomass across all scenarios, and the largest increases occurred under scenarios of high prey vulnerability to BHCs and high BHC production rates. High projected BHC biomass in Saginaw Bay and Lake Erie had negative effects on zooplankton and planktivorous fish groups and mixed effects on piscivores but had relatively negligible effects on most other food web groups across all scenarios. Our results are consistent with reported BHC effects on food webs in the Mississippi River and its tributaries and inform efforts to prevent BHC invasion of the Great Lakes."

The results were as follows: 1. Dried fibrous proteins and dried sarcoplasm proteins separated from fish meat have given a good functional properties compared to commercial cow's albumin. 2. It was found that the percentage of solubility and gelatinization of commercial cow's albumin protein was higher than in the myofibrillars and sarcoplasmic proteins separated from the two types of fish, whereas the amount of water absorbed by the commercial cow's albumin protein was less than of myofibrillars and sarcoplasmic proteins, while the amount of absorbed oil, viscosity, and emulsion composition. The commercial cow's albumin was comparable to the myofibrillars and sarcoplasmic proteins, and when comparing the foam properties of the myofibrillars and sarcoplasmic proteins of common carp and silver carp with the commercial cow's albumin at a concentration of 1% and at the normal pH=7, it was found that the foam size and persistence of sarcooplasmic proteins were close to the size and persistence of the foam for the commercial protein at the normal pH, while the volume and stability of the foam for myofibrillars proteins were slightly lower than in cow's albumin. 3. It was observed that the solubility values in the myofibrillars proteins and the sarcoplasmic proteins of the samples were close to each other when using preservation methods while the solubility of the myofibrillars proteins was lower than the solubility of the sarcoplasm proteins of the cooked samples. It was found that the amount of oil absorbed by the myofibrillars proteins was higher than the sarcoplasmic proteins, but that its viscosity and its ability to bind water and its ability to form gel were lower than it, and the capacity of emulsifiers of protein myofibrillars and their stability was higher than the capacity and the stability of emulsions of sarcoplasm proteins, as for the type of fish and the type of protein stability of emulsions, it was noted that there was a slight difference in the capacity of emulsions and the stability of emulsions for myofibrillars proteins as well as for sarcoplasm proteins. The emulsification values did not seem different between the two types of fish. 4. It was found that freezing contributed to reducing solubility and the amount of water absorbed while it had a role in increasing the amount of oil absorbed to fish proteins more than salting and drying. The freezing, as well as salting and drying were reduced the viscosity of proteins a little bit, also freezing reduced stability of emulsionsfor two type of fish proteins,but salting and drying was rised it, and the degree of influence of the measured foam property in myofibrillars and sarcoplasmic proteins of the fish species by means of preservation and cooking different methods was very small because the values were closely related, and we did not find a specific pattern that we could apply in terms of challenging degree of difference, freezing and salting with drying, grilling and frying and cooking in the broth sometimes susceptibility raises values formation of foam and other reduce it. 5. The solubility of proteins that measured on fish which cooked in broth was more than the solubility of grilled and fried samples. It was observed that the solubility values in myofibrillars proteins and sarcoplasm proteins for the cooked samples were close to each other, and the amount of water and absorbed oil, foam properties and viscosity of the measured proteins in cooked fish were not affected by the cooked methods whose used because the closely related of values. 6. Generally the results showed that the solubility and viscosity values in the samples of common carp were lower than in the silver carp which preserved and cooked by different ways, but the ability of common carp to bind the oil was higher than that of silver carp when using conservation methods while the values were close at the use of cooking methods, and we noted that there were no noticeable differences between myofibrillars proteins and sarcoplasmic proteins for the two fish species in their ability to bind water and their ability to form gel. It was also noted that there was a slight difference in the capacity of emulsions and their stability to myofibrillars proteins as well as to proteins sarcoplasm between the two types of fish. 7. The fish type, preservation methods, cooking methods, and di-interference had a significant effect at the probability level (P ≤ 0.05) on the percentage of solubility and the amount of water and oil absorbed by the myofibrillars and sarcoplasmic proteins separated from the meat of these fish, but did not significantly impact the viscosity of the protein."

A mechanistic understanding of interactions between nonnative prey and native predators is needed to assess the potential for predator regulation of Hypophthalmichthys carp populations and impacts on native predator assemblages. We conducted a series of experiments to quantify the selectivity and efficiency of Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides predation on juveniles of both of these Hypophthalmichthys species and behaviors that potentially influence this selectivity and efficiency. Selectivity was measured over 24 h in 2-m-diameter pools containing one of two prey assemblages consisting of three individuals from each of three species: (1) Bighead Carp with native littoral (Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus) and pelagic prey (Golden Shiner Notemigonus crysoleucas) or (2) Bighead Carp, Silver Carp, and a morphologically similar native prey (Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum). Foraging efficiency and predator-prey behaviors were quantified in 45-min trials in which Largemouth Bass foraged on 10 individuals of a single prey species inside a 750-L observation tank. All prey species were readily attacked and consumed by Largemouth Bass; Silver Carp were selected less often than Gizzard Shad, and Bighead Carp were selected at a higher rate than any of the other prey species. Of the species tested, Bighead Carp formed the tightest schools and were captured most efficiently by Largemouth Bass. Overall, Hypophthalmichthys carps were similar to native prey in their vulnerability to Largemouth Bass; therefore, factors affecting Hypophthalmichthys carp availability relative to native prey may shape postinvasion predator-prey interactions."

Planktivorous silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Valenciennes, 1844) is among the potential target species for such a fishery. Therefore, a desk-top human health risk assessment was conducted for silver carp from Lake Flag Boshielo.

The epidermis of the upper lip was characterized by the presence of large number of metachromatic mucous goblet cells, which showed positive reaction with Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS), Alcian blue (AB), and toluidine blue. The electroreceptive lateral line system was organized into ampullary and tuberous organs. The scanning electron microscopy showed that the surface of the skin of upper lip was covered by microridges and characterized by the presence of taste buds and openings of lateral line system. As observed by transmission electron microscopy, the cytoplasm of the epidermal layers appeared electron-dense except for the superficial layer, where the cytoplasm was electron-lucent and contained many vacuoles and few profiles of rER. Moreover, the epidermis contained rodlet cells and stem cells. Few organelles were found within the cytoplasm of club cells. Neutrophils and eosinophilic granular cells were also demonstrated as important immune cells in the epidermis of the upper lip. Furthermore, lymphocytes and basophils could be identified with macrophage in the epidermal layer of the upper lip.

A better understanding of factors that influence spatial patterns of bigheaded carp reproduction can help fisheries managers to prevent their spread. To examine factors that influence spatial patterns of reproduction, we sampled ichthyoplankton by using drift nets and push nets in three tributaries of the Illinois and Wabash rivers during March-September 2016-2018. We compared relative abundances of bigheaded carp eggs and larvae among tributaries by using CPUE. Abiotic data were analyzed from individual study tributaries and were pooled among tributaries with substantial versus minimal evidence of bigheaded carp reproduction. In total, 5,689 larval bigheaded carp were captured during three sampling seasons. Of the six study tributaries, we captured the most bigheaded carp larvae in the Sangamon River, followed by the Little Wabash, Embarras, Spoon, Mackinaw, and Vermilion rivers. Based on previous literature, we investigated differences in watershed area, discharge, water temperature, turbidity, and free-flowing stretches of river in our study tributaries. In general, tributaries with greater relative abundances of bigheaded carp eggs and larvae had larger watersheds, greater discharge, lower Secchi depths (higher turbidity), and longer free-flowing stretches than those with minimal evidence of reproduction. This study provides a thorough investigation of bigheaded carp reproduction in six large-river tributaries and will help fisheries managers to better monitor and mediate the spread of these invaders by facilitating the prioritization of potential monitoring locations."

Studies have shown that elevated levels of carbon dioxide gas (CO2) have the ability to act as a nonphysical fish barrier, but little work has been done on the efficacy of CO2 to deter fish movement in flowing water. An annular swim flume was used to measure U-burst and sprint duration of the model species largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) across a range of pCO(2) levels (<400atm [ambient]; 10,000atm; 50,000atm; and 100,000atm). This species was tested as a proxy because of the likelihood of a similar CO2 response being produced, as well as constraints in obtaining and housing appropriately sized Asian carp. A significant decrease in U-burst swimming occurred when exposed to 100,000atm. No effects on sprint duration were detected. In both swimming tests, 15% of fish lost equilibrium when exposed to 50,000atm pCO(2), while 50% of fish lost equilibrium when exposed to 100,000atm. Together, results define target levels for managers to impede the spread of largemouth bass and potentially other invasive freshwater fishes, helping guide policy to conserve aquatic ecosystems."

These studies are implemented by collecting water samples from the water body, processing those samples to isolate genetic material contained in the water sample, and using a laboratory assay to find a species-specific genetic marker within a sample of the genetic material. To date, conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been one of the most widely used assays in field studies to detect eDNA. This assay is strictly a test for the presence of the genetic marker. It provides no estimate of the concentration of the target genetic marker in the sample or in the environment. Understanding the concentration of a target marker in the environment is a critical first step toward using the results of eDNA field surveys to support inferences about the location and strength of eDNA sources. In this study, the results of eDNA field surveys are combined with a model of the sensitivity of the field survey methods to estimate target marker concentrations using Bayesian updating. The method is demonstrated for Asian carp in the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) using the results of field surveys for eDNA carried out during the period 2009 through 2012, a four-year period during which more than 5,800 two-liter water samples were collected and analyzed using PCR. Concentrations of bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) eDNA are estimated for twenty hydrologic reaches of the CAWS. This study also assesses the sensitivity of these concentration estimates to evidentiary criteria that limit what evidence is used in Bayesian updating based on requirements for sampling intensity and frequency."

We considered the most cost‐effective gear to be the one that provided the largest catch at a minimal expenditure of labor. Mini‐fyke nets were the most effective at collecting large numbers of age‐0 Silver Carp, followed in decreasing order by beach seines, pulsed‐DC electrofishing, purse seines, and gill nets. The smallest Silver Carp were caught in beach seines and the largest were caught in gill nets, and there was considerable variation in size distributions among gears. However, when we considered cost‐effectiveness in terms of labor hours for each gear, both beach seines and mini‐fyke nets had similar and overlapping labor expenditures. Gill nets and purse seines were not cost‐effective, as they required more labor and had lower overall catch rates.

To better understand the hydraulics associated with substrate on fish swimming, we studied the effects of a vertical half cylinder (hereafter, cylinder) on the critical swimming speed of juvenile silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). Absolute and relative critical swimming speeds of fish in the flow field of the cylinder were significantly increased compared with those swimming in free flow. In addition, the amplitude of fish head and tail oscillations were significantly greater in flows created by the half cylinder.

Hypophthalmichthys molitrix"	"Turbulence is a complex hydraulic phenomenon which commonly occurs in natural streams and fishways. Riverine fish are subjected to heterogeneous flow velocities and turbulence, which may affect their movements and ability to pass the fishways. However, studies focusing on fish response to turbulent flows are lacking for many species. Here we investigate the effects of the turbulence created by a vertical half‐cylinder of various diameters (1.9, 2.5, 3.2 and 5.0 cm) on the swimming ability and behaviour of silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix. The large D‐cylinders (3.0 and 5.0 cm) create specific vorticity and reduced velocities areas in their vicinity, which favours flow refuging behaviours (FRBs) and thus increased relative critical swimming speeds (Urcrit, BL/s) of silver carp, by comparison to free‐flow conditions and cylinders of smaller diameter (1.9 and 2.5 cm). The flow speed at which silver carp maximized FRBs such as Karman gaiting downstream of the cylinder, holding position in the bow wake or entraining on the side ranged from 40 to 70 cm s−1, depending on fish body size. When holding station near a cylinder under optimal flow speeds, the distance between the fish and the cylinder is related to the size of the fish, but also to the size of the cylinder and the produced vortices. The optimal holding region in the drag wake of the cylinder ranged from 28 to 40 cm downstream of the centre of the cylinder, depending on the size of the fish. Smaller fish, however, tend to use the reduced velocities areas located in the bow wake of the large cylinders. We hypothesize that fish will display FRBs, including maintaining a Karman gait in turbulent flow, when the ratio of the cylinder diameter to their body length is between 1:3 and 1:4. They also match their tail beat frequency to the vortex shedding frequency of the cylinder. Our results provide a better understanding of how silver carp respond to turbulent flows around physical structures, with implications for the design of nature‐like fishways or exclusion devices in both its native and invasive ranges."

Hypophthalmichthys molitrix"	"We currently have only a minimal understanding of energy‐saving strategies of fish in unsteady flows. In this study, we found that obstacle shape can affect swimming ability of fish: our results suggested that a half cylinder improved critical swimming speed of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) compared with swimming downstream of a full cylinder, square tube or for free‐flow conditions. We also discovered how silver carp alter their locomotory behavior in response to turbulent flow caused by varying flow velocities around obstacles. At a flow velocity of 1 BL/s (body length per second), the fish spent similar percentages of time between holding station and moving forward behind the half cylinder: their motions resembled freestream swimming behavior. The greatest percentage of time spent downstream of the half cylinder occurred at a flow velocity of 5 BL/s. Fish were unstable and displayed irregular body motions with large lateral displacement at 5 BL/s. However, the fish held station for a long time and moved forward steadily behind the half cylinder at 3 BL/s. In holding station behind the half cylinder, fish maintained constant tail‐beat frequency and tail‐ beat amplitude when flow velocity was increased from 1 to 3 BL/s. In moving forward behind the half cylinder, fish increased tail‐beat frequency and tail‐beat amplitude while maintaining constant ground swimming speed, swimming acceleration and ground stride when flow velocity was increased from 3 to 5 BL/s. Moreover, fish positioned their snouts in a small area approximately 1–3 BL downstream from the half cylinder at 3 BL/s. These behaviors support the hypothesis that turbulence behind a half cylinder was a suitable location for fish to conserve energy at 3 BL/s. Our results indicate that the combined effect of obstacles and flow velocity influence fish locomotory behavior, and some combinations may be beneficial to fish energy expenditure swimming in unsteady flow."

The use of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) to reduce excessive phytoplankton development is controversial. In the case of cyanobacteria, many of which are toxic, understanding their possible digestion mechanism by fish is particularly desirable. A unique methodical approach, which consists of applying intestinal contents or extracts to a cyanobacteria culture, was used. Unicellular cyanobacteria (Cyanothece) were incubated in vitro with bile, contents of different parts of the intestinal tract, and cytosolic and microsomal extracts of the intestinal tissue of silver carp. The abundance of cyanobacteria decreased in all treatments containing either exclusively bile or its combination with intestinal contents. This research provides the first evidence of non-mechanical digestion of cyanobacteria by silver carp. Cyanobacteria incubated with intestinal contents or extracts reached mostly higher abundances than those incubated with the nutrient medium. The existence of non-mechanical digestion mediated via intestinal contents and extracts or its compensation connected with organic substance uptake is discussed."

A radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) model was established to predict the changes in the microbial content of silver carp. The critical temperature for inactivation of Enterobacteriaceae and lactic acid bacteria was 65 °C and for Pseudomonas and Psychrotrophs was 70 °C and the highest value (75 °C) was observed for the total viable count. In samples processed at 75 °C, the presence of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas and Psychrotrophs were not detectable up to 15 days of storage and lactic acid bacteria were not detectable even at the end of the storage period. The optimal ANN topology for modeling Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, and Psychrotroph contained 9 neurons in the hidden layer, but for TVC and LAB, it was 14 neurons."

It is difficult for the common people to directly identify the fish species found in the market. Classifying fish species from images based on visual characteristics using computer vision and machine learning techniques is an interesting problem for the researchers. However, the classifier's performance depends upon quality of image dataset on which it has been trained. An imagery dataset is needed to examine the classification and recognition algorithms. This article exhibits Fish-Pak: an image dataset of 6 different fish species, captured by a single camera from different pools located nearby the Head Qadirabad, Chenab River in Punjab, Pakistan. The dataset Fish-Pak are quite useful to compare various factors of classifiers such as learning rate, momentum and their impact on the overall performance. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most widely used architectures for image classification based on visual features. Six data classes i.e. Ctenopharyngodon idella (Grass carp), Cyprinus carpio (Common carp), Cirrhinus mrigala (Mori), Labeo rohita (Rohu), Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Silver carp), and Catla (Thala), with a different number of images, have been included in the dataset. Fish species are captured by one camera to ensure the fair environment to all data.

Experiments were conducted in batch process, and a number of influencing parameters, such as solution pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time, and initial Congo red concentration, were thoroughly investigated for optimization. Kinetic and equilibrium data were well described by pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir isotherm, respectively. Suitability of pseudo-second-order model to best fit with the adsorption process was corroborated by squared sum of errors analysis. Mass transfer mechanism was confirmed by intraparticle pore diffusion and Bangham’s diffusion models. Maximum sorption capacity of fish bone powder was found to be 666.67 mg·g−1. The optimum condition (adsorbent dose: 5 g·L−1; pH: 2.0; operating time: 4 h) for maximum sorption was determined as well. The increasing negative value of Gibbs free energy (ΔG) with temperature rise indicated spontaneous nature and feasibility of adsorption. The positive values of ΔH and ΔS suggested that the adsorption reaction is endothermic and random (at the solid/liquid interface) in nature. The activation energy (29.84 kJ·mol−1) indicated that the sorption process was of physisorption type. A considerably high adsorption capacity pointed towards utilization of this apparently useless biomaterial as an effective adsorbent."

Bangladesh"	"Worldwide, water regulatory structures have impacts on aquatic ecological connectivity. This study determined the effects of current sluice management on the fish community in the Baral River, a major connection to the largest wetland (Chalan Beel) in Bangladesh. It also examines wider problems for biodiversity conservation (particularly waterbirds) in that wetland, which has shrunk to 30% of its former dry‐season size in 50 years. During the flood period, the peak breeding time for native floodplain fishes, sluices were in undershot operation (open by 16–60% of water depth). During this time, fish abundance and species richness were 229% and 155% higher respectively at sites upstream of the sluices, despite similar habitat upstream and downstream. Outside this period, when sluices were fully open, abundance and species richness were similar upstream and downstream. Fish samples were dominated by fry, which are susceptible to damage by sluices. Twenty (41.7%) of 48 fish species captured in this study are classed as threatened in Bangladesh and their abundance was significantly lower downstream of the sluices. Two alien species, Aristichthys nobilis and Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, were recorded, probably escapees from local aquaculture activities. Twenty‐five species of wetland birds were recorded in the Chalan Beel. From interviews, 64% of these species appear to have decreased in the last 20 years, together with 11 more species that may have become locally extinct over this period. This suggests that widespread ecological disruption is occurring. Improved water management (e.g. gate opening height and duration) or modification (e.g. fish pass) of the Baral sluices is needed, to meet biodiversity and fisheries needs, rather than just for flood control and crop production. Improved hydrological and ecological connectivity and habitat protection are needed, as are a cessation of destructive fishing and seasonal fish ranching practices that currently provide synergistic pressures."

However, the benefit of stocking silver carp to restore eutrophic lakes remains controversial and the reasons for the different responses observed are unclear. In this study, we conducted an outdoor experiment to assess the impact of the biomass level of four silver carp (c. 0, 25, 50, and 100 g/m(3)) on phytoplankton through direct grazing and fish-mediated nutrient recycling, respectively. We used a nested design with nutrient-permeable chambers with or without fish placed inside ponds. In this way, the phytoplankton incubated outside the chambers was affected by both consumer grazing and nutrient recycling, whereas the phytoplankton inside the fish-free chambers was only affected by consumer-mediated nutrient recycling. Outside the chambers, the concentrations of total nitrogen, dissolved total nitrogen, and total phosphorus did not differ significantly among the treatments, whereas the dissolved total phosphorus level was significantly higher in the fishless treatment. The concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl a), phytoplankton biomass and the ratio of nanophytoplankton Chl a to total phytoplankton Chl a in the fish-present treatments were significantly higher than in the fishless treatment and the phytoplankton was dominated by small-sized species. While the zooplankton biomass and zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratio were significantly lower in the fish-present treatments, indicating a strong fish predation on zooplankton. As for the water inside the chambers, there was no significant difference among the four treatments for any of the measured variables except total phosphorus. Our results suggest that silver carp indirectly stimulated phytoplankton growth by reducing the zooplankton grazing rather than through nutrient recycling, and that fish grazing on phytoplankton could not compensate for the loss of grazing by zooplankton, leading to higher phytoplankton biomass when silver carp was present. The benefit of using filter-feeding fish as a biomanipulation tool to create clear water is therefore questionable unless control of nanophytoplankton can be achieved."

We used automatic methods, which acquire fish swimming tracks using computer vision (video). We examined the flow field using hydrodynamic software simulation; then, using the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm, each frame of the flow field was divided into areas of different velocity. Finally, the automatic fish trajectory tracking was coupled with hydraulic simulation of the flow field to compute an estimate of the time fish spent in each velocity area.

Traditional analyses often assume uncorrelated or weakly correlated temporal structure in fisheries data time series. We propose that frequency and scale domain methods, in the form of wavelet transforms, can serve as useful probes in early investigations of fisheries data, finding out the mechanisms underlying the changes in the diversity and abundance of fishes. We used cross-wavelet analysis with phase angle and coherency parameters to study the effect of discharge on the occurrence of silver carp larvae in a large subtropical river. Simulation studies show that the spectral signature given by the cross-wavelet method provided a useful approach for statistically detecting and characterizing temporal dependency in the occurrence of fish larvae. In addition, our simulations provide an objective, quantitative basis for understanding how river flow rate acts as a trigger for the occurrence of larvae. And our results can be used to ecological operation silver carp larvae were found when discharge was greater than 10(4) m(3) s(-1). The flood peak persists for some days (at least 2 days) and can induce a peak in larval abundance. Our analyses also show that flood duration and the flood total volume decreased from 2006 to 2013. Moreover the flood occurred earlier each year. This may be why the period of most intense spawning (the day of maximum larvae collected) was earlier each year. We conclude with a discussion about the role wavelet analysis may have in appropriately guiding flexible probabilistic models connecting fisheries with environmental covariates. The wavelet approach is an especially promising tool for analyzing ecological data, such as the relationship between hydrological conditions and fish larva occurrence."

In many cases, their condition is approaching a crisis or has already acquired it. The flow of various pollutants into rivers results in significant changes in hydrochemical characteristics. The state environmental monitoring of water bodies uses a comprehensive approach, but not all water bodies are covered by state monitoring. We have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the ecological status of water bodies in Central Polissya, using current and retrospective data of hydrochemical, hydrobiological analysis for rivers described in this article. The article presents the results of the ecological assessment of surface water quality of rivers Uzh and Irsha, taking into account hydrochemical parameters that indicate the polluted state (class III) during 2018-2020 with a significant contribution and in the formation of the quality class of salt composition, trophosaprobiological block, and block of other toxic substances. Flushing from urban areas contributes a significant share to the pollution of Polissya's surface springs. An essential component of bioresources is fish stocks, which have been declining in recent years. The main factors hindering the development of fisheries and negatively affecting the reproduction of fish stocks are pollution of water bodies, violation of the hydrological regime, weakening of state control over the catch and sale of aquatic living resources. Analysis of the age composition of the ichthyofauna of the studied rivers by catching nets and tools for catching young fish makes it possible to determine perch (Perca fluviatilis) and silver carp (Carassius gibelio) dominate in the reservoirs. Currently, fish stocks in the rivers of the Dnieper basin are under intense pressure from poaching, which is one of the most negative anthropogenic factors."

However, traditional capture-based morphological surveys require considerable taxonomic expertise, are time consuming and expensive, can kill rare taxa and damage habitats, and often are prone to false negatives. Alternatively, metabarcoding assays can be used to assess the genetic identity and compositions of entire communities from environmental samples, comprising a more sensitive, less damaging, and relatively time- and cost-efficient approach. However, there is a trade-off between the stringency of bioinformatic filtering needed to remove false positives and the potential for false negatives. The present investigation thus evaluated use of four mitochondrial (mt) DNA metabarcoding assays and a customized bioinformatic Bioinformatic pipeline to increase confidence in species identifications by removing false positives, while achieving high detection probability. Positive controls were used to calculate sequencing error, and results that fell below those cutoff values were removed, unless found with multiple assays. The performance of this approach was tested to discern and identify North American freshwater fishes using lab experiments (mock communities and aquarium experiments) and processing of a bulk ichthyoplankton sample. The method then was applied to field environmental (e) DNA water samples taken concomitant with electrofishing surveys and morphological identifications. This protocol detected 100% of species present in concomitant electrofishing surveys in the Wabash River and an additional 21 that were absent from traditional sampling. Using single 1 L water samples collected from just four locations, the metabarcoding assays discerned 73% of the total fish species that were discerned during four months of an extensive electrofishing river survey in the Maumee River, along with an additional nine species. In both rivers, total fish species diversity was best resolved when all four metabarcoding assays were used together, which identified 35 additional species missed by electrofishing. Ecological distinction and diversity levels among the fish communities also were better resolved with the metabarcoding assays than with morphological sampling and identifications, especially using all four assays together. At the population-level, metabarcoding analyses targeting the invasive round goby Neogobius melanostomus and the silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix identified all population haplotype variants found using Sanger sequencing of morphologically sampled fish, along with additional intra-specific diversity, meriting further investigation. Overall findings demonstrated that the use of multiple metabarcoding assays and custom bioinformatics that filter potential error from true positive detections improves confidence in evaluating biodiversity."

Retailers were questioned about supply chains, and anglers surveyed about baitfish use and disposal. Assays revealed unadvertised species eDNA in 100% of bait stores, with 61% containing illegal native non-bait (totaling 13 species) and 88% having AIS (11 species). Illegal native non-bait species included juvenile walleye, yellow perch, and white sucker eDNA. AIS eDNA included Eurasian ruffe in seven stores (all states), silver carp in five (including a Lake Erie store in two separate years), and bighead carp in two Lake Erie stores that also had silver carp. Among pond stores, two in Lake St. Clair had bighead carp eDNA, one also contained silver carp, and a Wabash River location showed European ide. Unadvertised invasive snails were discerned in 55% of pond stores. Four contained zebra mussel eDNA and two had invasive bryozoans. Illegal native species and AIS were widespread, but showed little relationship to the retailers' variable and extensive supply chains. Live baitfish releases were reported by 50% of Lake Erie anglers and 35% in Lake St. Clair. Consumer behavior and AIS prevalence in the bait and pond trades thus pose serious risks for introductions and spread."	"10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108430"	"internal-pdf://2961593910/noaa_30627_DS1.pdf"

Optimizing eDNA sampling protocols can be challenging because there is imperfect understanding of how each step of the protocol influences its sensitivity. This paper develops a probabilistic model that characterizes each step of an eDNA sampling protocol to evaluate the protocol's overall detection sensitivity for one sample. The model is then applied to analyse how changes over time made to the eDNA sampling protocol to detect bighead (BH) and silver carp (SC) eDNA have influenced its sensitivity, and hence interpretation of the results. The model shows that changes to the protocol have caused the sensitivity of the protocol to fluctuate. A more efficient extraction method in 2013, new species-specific markers with a qPCR assay in 2014, and a more efficient capture method in 2015 have improved the sensitivity, while switching to a larger elution volume in 2013 and a smaller sample volume in 2015 have reduced the sensitivity. Overall, the sensitivity of the current protocol is higher for BH eDNA detection and SC eDNA detection compared to the original protocol used from 2009 to 2012. The paper shows how this model of eDNA sampling can be used to evaluate the effect of proposed changes in an eDNA sampling and analysis protocol on the sensitivity of that protocol to help researchers optimize their design."

One confounding factor when interpreting eDNA sampling evidence is that eDNA can be present in the water in the absence of living target organisms, originating from excreta, dead tissue, boats, or sewage effluent, etc. In the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS), electric fish dispersal barriers were built to prevent non-native Asian carp species from invading Lake Michigan, and yet Asian carp eDNA has been detected above the barriers sporadically since 2009. In this paper the influence of stream flow characteristics in the CAWS on the probability of invasive Asian carp eDNA detection in the CAWS from 2009 to 2012 was examined. In the CAWS, the direction of stream flow is mostly away from Lake Michigan, though there are infrequent reversals in flow direction towards Lake Michigan during dry spells. We find that the flow reversal volume into the Lake has a statistically significant positive relationship with eDNA detection probability, while other covariates, like gage height, precipitation, season, water temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, pH and chlorophyll concentration do not. This suggests that stream flow direction is highly influential on eDNA detection in the CAWS and should be considered when interpreting eDNA evidence. We also find that the beta-binomial regression model provides a stronger fit for eDNA detection probability compared to a binomial regression model. This paper provides a statistical modeling framework for interpreting eDNA sampling evidence and for evaluating covariates influencing eDNA detection. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Using electro-olfactogram recording (EOG), we found that the olfactory system of this species is acutely sensitive to three F-series prostaglandins (PGFs) at picomolar concentrations and that this sensitivity is enhanced when juveniles are masculinized using androgens, consistent with expectations of a sex pheromone. Individual PGFs had behavioral activity but it was low, suggesting a mixture might be important. To pursue this possibility, we implanted carps with osmotic pumps containing prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α), a treatment previously shown to elicit release of a PGF-based spawning pheromone in the Common Carp. We found that PGF2α-implanted Silver Carp released a species-specific odor that contained a blend of PGF2α and two of its metabolites, which masculinized individuals detected and were attracted to with high sensitivity. Finally, we found that a mixture of these PGFs was attractive to masculinized Silver Carp, while a different mixture released by Bighead Carp was not. We conclude that Silver Carp likely use a species-specific PGF2α-derived sex pheromone that is probably released at spawning and might be useful in its control. Confirmatory studies that explore pheromone function in naturally mature Silver Carp using natural odors in the field should now be conducted to further confirm our proof-of-concept study."

Using boat-mounted cameras, we recorded video of invasive Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix in the field as they were leaping from the water and measured their leap height, horizontal distance, and angle of escape and estimated their escape velocity. Leap characteristics, fish morphometrics, and environmental data were measured from populations of carp in Mississippi, Missouri, and Illinois. The means for leap height and distance (+/- SE) across all of the study areas were 125 +/- 5.54 and 209 +/- 9.10 cm, respectively. The maximum leap height that was recorded was 276.08 cm (in Ramsey Creek, Missouri), and the maximum distance was 482.34 cm (in DeSoto Lake, Mississippi), both more than double the mean values. The majority of carp (66.1%) leaped at angles between 46 degrees and 65 degrees. The mean water escape velocities (WEV) varied across the three study sites. The velocities in Missouri, 628.4 +/- 31.6 cm/s, were significantly higher than they were in Mississippi, 471.2 +/- 16.9 cm/s or in Illinois, 551.7 +/- 20.6 cm/s. The maximum measured escape velocity was 771 cm/s, but the maximum estimated WEV was substantially higher at 1,280 cm/s. Larger Silver Carp were captured at lower latitudes: 54.79 +/- 0.74 cm in Illinois, 60.86 +/- 0.75 cm in Missouri, and 73.09 +/- 1.03 cm in Mississippi. A regression analysis indicated that leap distance and height were correlated with fish size, escape velocity, and angle of escape and that escape velocity was correlated with streamflow velocity, fish size, and water temperature. This study provides a first-time quantification of the leap characteristics and escape velocities of Silver Carp, which we believe approximates their maximum burst swim speeds. Therefore, these data can be used to develop or refine effective vertical and hydraulic barriers to the dispersal of Silver Carp. The data also demonstrate that the leaping and high-speed swimming capabilities of Silver Carp are greater than has been assumed previously."

This large, prolific filter-feeder reduces food availability for other fishes. It now has reached the threshold of the Laurentian Great Lakes, where it likely will significantly impact food chains and fisheries. Our study evaluates population genetic variability and differentiation of the silver carp using 10 nuclear DNA microsatellite loci, and sequences of two mitochondrial genes–cytochrome b and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, along with the nuclear ribosomal protein S7 gene intron 1. We analyze population samples from: two primary Great Lakes’ invasion fronts (at the Illinois River outside of Chicago, IL in Lake Michigan and in the Wabash River, which leads into the Maumee River and western Lake Erie), the original establishment “core” in the Lower Mississippi River, and expansion areas in the Upper Mississippi and Missouri rivers. We analyze and compare our results with bighead and other invasive carps, and cyprinid relatives. Results reveal that the silver carp invasion possesses moderate levels of genetic diversity, with more mtDNA haplotypes and unique microsatellite alleles in the “core” Lower Mississippi River population, which also diverges the most. The two invasion fronts also significantly genetically differ. About 3% of individuals (including all populations except the Illinois River) contain a unique and very divergent mtDNA haplotype, which likely stems from historic introgression in Asia with female largescale silver carp H. harmandi. The nuclear microsatellites and S7 sequences of the introgressed individuals do not differ from silver carp and are very distant from bighead carp. These sequence variation data are employed to design and evaluate a targeted high-throughput metabarcoding sequence assay that identifies and distinguishes among species of invasive carps (i.e., silver, bighead, grass, black, and common carps, along with goldfish), as well as native cyprinids, using cytochrome b. Our assay further differentiates among selected silver carp haplotypes (including between H. molitrix and H. harmandi), for use in population genetics and future analyses of spread pathways. We test and evaluate this assay on environmental (e)DNA water samples from 48 bait shops in the Great Lakes’ region (along the Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair, and Wabash River watersheds), using positive and negative controls and custom bioinformatic processing. Test results discern silver carp eDNA in four of the shops–three in Lake Erie and one in the Wabash River watershed–and bighead carp from one of the same Lake Erie venues, suggesting that retailers (who often source from established southerly populations) comprise another introduction vector. Our overall findings thus provide key population genetic and phylogenetic data for understanding and tracing introductions, vectors, and spread pathways for silver carp, their variants, and their relatives."

Predicting population collapse and understanding the self-reinforced feedback mechanisms that erode the resilience of native species are two major challenges in invasion ecology. However, to date, empirical evidence of species invasion-induced regime shifts remains scarce, and the minimum required data to generate early warning signals (EWSs) before critical transitions remains unclear, despite its importance for ecosystem management. By combining 80-year (i.e., 1936–2016) fishery data from Lake Qiandao and a theoretical competition model, we provide evidence that relative to nutrient enrichment and climate change, stocking alien fish species of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Aristichthys nobtilis) is the most important driver leading to the collapse of local fish populations. Detectable EWSs indicated by the variance, autocorrelation and composite resilience indicators require at least ten years of data before an abrupt decline, demonstrating that a long-term ecological monitoring program is necessary for providing insight into resilience dynamics. A structural equation model (SEM) suggests that the combined effects of eutrophication, high water levels and carp stocking-induced water clarity decline may play an important role in the reduced fitness of local fish populations, which subsequently increase the carrying capacity of alien fish populations. Our results demonstrate that stocking alien carps result in competitive exclusion of local fish populations, especially in the current context of water eutrophication and global climate changes. Furthermore, quantifying the minimum required time series length with detectable EWS across various ecosystems should be further studied given that this information is critical for flexible management policies to take actions to avert the harmful transitions."

India"	"The inland fisheries resources of India are vast and comprise of river systems with tributaries and distributaries, network of canals crisscrossing the country, scores of natural lakes, reservoirs, estuaries and lagoons. Reservoirs are classified as small (<1000 ha), medium (1000 to 5000 ha) and large (>5000 ha). Small reservoirs are prime resources for capture fisheries and being used for extensive aquaculture. Biodiversity would apparently seem to be most unambiguous and easily studied of ecological concepts. Biodiversity refers to the variety and variability among organisms and ecosystem complexes in which they occur. It includes diversity of forms right from the molecular unit to the individual organisms and then to the populations, communities, ecosystem, landscapes and biosphere. The ichthyofaunal studies concentrates primarily on fish diversity and related indices. The main problem in developing the fisheries of reservoirs has been, inadequate stocking of advanced fingerlings, stocking of small sized fingerlings, skewed proportion of stocked fingerlings and inappropriate release of fingerlings at a specific place and time. Tilapia, African catfish and Red bellied fish (Pacchu / Pagu) has become a dominant species with landings comprising small-sized fishes in many of the small and big reservoirs. The love among the people for the exotics has found another niche and reservoirs are being stocked with silver carp, grass carp and common carp to the detriment of indigenous fauna. It is time that fast growing local species with a consumer preference and high economic value are stocked with efforts to produce their seed close to the reservoir concerned. Owing to these variables, the present review work has been planned with ichthyofaunal studies and outlined on fish diversity, aquaculture fish production, native fish fauna identification, breeding and development of seed production techniques, threats and conservation of reservoir fisheries. Based on the literature review made, the conservation strategies were suggested for the effective management and conservation actions concerning to Indian reservoirs."

Management of any species relies on an accurate understanding of population characteristics and dynamics. However, Silver Carp seasonal sampling variation is unknown. Sampling during periods of peak catch rates would facilitate Silver Carp assessment and management, improving monitoring and removal techniques. The objective of this study was to evaluate adult Silver Carp seasonal sampling variation with boat electroshocking and trammel nets. Silver Carp were collected monthly (April-October) during 2014 and 2015 from four locations in the Des Moines River, Iowa. Trammel nets rarely captured Silver Carp (mean +/- SE = 4.9 +/- 1.6 fish/net; 60% of fish were captured in 6.3% of net sets) and therefore were not included in analyses. Electroshocking catch rates (CPUEs) exhibited a bimodal distribution, with peak CPUEs generally occurring in May, June, and September and lower catch rates observed during July and August. Catch rates were positively related to river discharge at upstream sites but not at downstream sites. Silver Carp size structure was similar among months and sites except at Cliffland, where fish were smaller during August and October compared to earlier in the year. Finally, Silver Carp condition peaked during April and May and decreased throughout the year except at Keokuk, where peaks were observed during both May and August. Although spatiotemporal variability was substantial, these results suggest that sampling of Silver Carp via electroshocking in May-June and September-October generally produces higher catch rates compared to July-August sampling and generates a more representative size structure. Using site-specific knowledge, monitoring and surveillance programs could more effectively sample during these periods of high vulnerability and densities in order to manage the spread and impacts of Silver Carp at statewide and regionwide scales."

However, this variability can be synchronous at broad geographic scales due to fish dispersal and climatic conditions. Herein, we investigated recruitment synchrony of Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix across the Mississippi River basin. Year-class strength (YCS) and synchrony of nine populations (maximum linear distance=806.4km) were indexed using catch-curve residuals correlated between sites and related to local and regional climatic conditions. Overall, Silver Carp YCS was not synchronous among populations, suggesting that local environmental factors are more important determinants of YCS than large-scale environmental factors. Variation in Silver Carp YCS was influenced by river base flow and discharge variability at each site, indicating that extended periods of static local discharge benefit YCS. Furthermore, river discharge and air temperature were correlated and synchronized among sites, butonly similarities in river discharge were correlated with Silver Carp population synchrony, indicating thatsimilarities in discharge (i.e., major flood) among sites can positively synchronize Silver Carp YCS. The positivecorrelation between Silver Carp YCS and river discharge synchrony suggests that regional flood regimes are an important force determining the degree of population synchrony among Mississippi River Silver Carp populations."

Established populations of invasive silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix are currently found throughout a large portion of the upper Mississippi River (UMR) basin. Despite their recent invasion and broad environmental tolerances, silver carp population ecology and linkages to environmental conditions in the UMR remain understudied. There were two objectives for this investigation: (a) to estimate correlations among population characteristics and the influence of latitude and the time since first detection, and (b) to model the influence of river discharge and temperature on growth early in life to age 3. We estimated spatial variability in silver carp population characteristics and dynamics from nine sites across the UMR and assessed if biotic, abiotic or invasion-related (time since first detection) variables influence spatial patterns. Silver carp body weight, size structure, annual mortality, and growth parameters varied among locations. Silver carp recruitment was less stable for populations with higher relative abundance estimates and where carp were first detected >= 20 years ago whereas maximum carp age decreased with increasing latitude. Although model selection indicated silver carp length at age 3 was associated with mean daily discharge (m(3)/s) coefficient of variation, mean May-June temperatures, and ordinal date of maximum discharge, parameter coefficients and effect sizes were small and not biologically meaningful. Our results suggest that silver carp populations are governed by intraspecific mechanisms, but time-dependent changes in populations may partially underpin heterogeneity across populations. Our study helped further disentangle silver carp population ecology in the UMR by understanding carp ecology as a function of their invasion."

Induced breeding of these species enlarged the geographical range for their culture as well as permitted more reliable seed supply. For the assessment of efficiency, long-term data from 18 spawning seasons on induced breeding of Chinese carps at a large-scale hatchery were evaluated. Assessment of ovulation was carried out by determining the ovulation ratio (number of ovulated females / number of injected females) x 100. The relative amount of stripped eggs (pseudo-gonadosomatic index, PGSI) was calculated as follows: (weight of stripped egg mass / body weight before stripping) x 100. We also analyzed the ovulation ratio and the PGSI relative to three different weight classes of females (small, medium and large). Over the 18 spawning seasons, 555 silver carp, 300 bighead carp and 1175 grass carp females were selected for propagation. Almost 80% of silver carp females selected belonged to categories between 4 and 7 kg. For grass carp and especially for bighead carp, breeders preferred higher weight categories. Ovulation ratios were similar between silver carp (80.9%), bighead carp (77.3%) and grass carp (79.1%). Mean PGSI for grass carp (9.3 +/- 4.26%) was significantly lower than that for silver carp (10.5 +/- 4.85%) and bighead carp (10.1 +/- 3.96). In silver carp and bighead carp, there were no significant differences in ovulation ratios and mean PGSI values among different weight classes. Mean PGSI values were also similar among different weight classes of grass carp females. Ovulation ratios, however, were different among the three different weight classes in grass carp being the lowest in the "small" weight class and the highest in the "large" weight class. These results will provide guidelines for Chinese carp breeders to select optimal brood fish for ovulation induction and calculate their hatchery's larval production in advance."

The results showed that the critical and burst swimming speed (m/s) of the four carps increased with the increased body length, and the relative (critical and burst) swimming speed (the critical and burst swimming speed divided by the body length, BL/s) decreases with body length. The critical and burst swimming speed of each species at two individual length groups (1.0–5.0 cm, 5.1–9.0 cm) was significantly different (p < 0.05), and the water velocities in fish passage should be less than the fish burst swimming speed.

Based on receiver operative characteristic curve analysis, thresholds were identified to distinguish between low, medium and high risk species. The "top invasive" (very high risk) species identified were: brown bullhead Ameiurus nebulosus, blue crab Callinectes sapidus, gibel carp Carassius gibelio, Philippine catfish Clarias batrachus, Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis, bluespotted cornetfish Fistularia commersonii, silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, silver-cheeked toadfish Lagocephalus sceleratus, half-smooth golden pufferfish Lagocephalus spadiceus, Suez pufferfish Lagocephalus suezensis, signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus, fathead minnow Pimephales promelas, channeled applesnail Pomacea canaliculata, red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii, devil firefish Pterois miles and European catfish Silurus glanis. The risk of being invasive of more than half of the screened species increased after taking global warming predictions into account, and several species considered to be globally invasive (cf. high risk) were classified as posing only a medium risk for the eastern Mediterranean region. Region-specific risk screenings, as implemented in this study, are therefore essential for setting priorities in preventative management for the conservation of key biodiversity hotspots and the optimal allocation of resources in view of full risk assessment for the species identified as (very) high risk."

Of the available decision-support tools, the Fish Invasiveness Screening Kit (FISK) has been widely used, but has recently been replaced by a generic screening tool, the Aquatic Species Invasiveness Screening Kit (AS-ISK), which is applicable to any aquatic species and complies with the minimum requirements for risk tools under the new EC alien invasive species Regulation. With its unique zoogeography and rich native fauna, Turkey is highly susceptible to non-native species' introductions and translocations. In order to inform non-native species policy and management regarding fishes in Turkey, AS-ISK was used to re-assess species previously screened using FISK and to assess additional non-native and translocated fish species. In this first calibration study of AS-ISK for Turkey, a basic score threshold of 28 was achieved, which reliably distinguished between potentially invasive (high risk) and potentially non-invasive (medium to low risk) fishes. Of the 64 species assessed, only one was ranked as 'low risk', 40 were categorised as 'medium risk', and the remaining 23 as 'high risk' of which five were translocated. Non-native species currently not present in Turkey, but that pose a high risk of being invasive, were Ameiurus melas, Ameiurus nebulosus, Hemiculter leucisculus, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Micropterus salmoides, Perccottus glenii, Pimephales promelas; whereas, the highest scoring translocated species were Cyprinus carpio, Esox lucius and Silurus glanis.

In this study, we identified and characterized the Tf gene in Megalobrama amblycephala and evaluated its expression in basal conditions as well as after iron overload and experimental infection with Aeromonas hydrophila. Furthermore, we studied the iron binding properties of recombinant Tf. The full-length M. amblycephala Tf complementary DNA (cDNA) (GenBank accession no.: KX698308) of 2245 bp was cloned and contained a 1953 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 650 amino acid residues and flanked by a 68 bp 5' and a 204 bp 3' untranslated regions (UTR). Predicted conservative structure illustrated that M. amblycephala Tf consisted of two conservative Tf domains. Amino acid sequence alignment revealed that M. amblycephala Tf had high similarity with that of cyprinids deposited in Genbank, and phylogenetic analysis showed that M. amblycephala Tf clustered with Ctenopharyngodon idella and Hypophthalmichthys molitrix. Tissue expression pattern analyses demonstrated that the liver was the main Tf mRNA expressing organ, being significantly higher than other tissues (p < 0.05). In the liver, Tf mRNA expression in fish artificially injected with the pathogenic bacteria A. hydrophila was significantly upregulated, reaching a peak at 12 h post injection (hpi) and then decreasing afterward. The expression in FeCl3-injected fish showed a similar tendency, but reached a peak at 8 hpi. Meanwhile, fish serum iron significantly decreased following A. hydrophila injection, but increased to peak at 4 hpi and then decreased in FeCl3-injected fish. The recombinant M. amblycephala Tf showed iron binding capacity using CAS analysis. These results are helpful to understand the structure and regulation of expression of Tf, as well as the specific function of Tf for both immune responses and iron homeostasis."

The potential for elevated CO2 to have similar negative impacts on freshwater communities remains understudied. The objective of our study was to quantify the effects of elevated CO2 on the behaviors of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) following exposure to conspecific skin extracts (alarm cues). In fathead minnows, their response to conspecific skin extracts was significantly impaired following exposure to elevated CO2 levels for at least 96 h, while silver carp behaviors were unaltered. However, fathead minnow behaviors did return to pre-CO2 exposure in high-CO2-exposed fish following 14 days of holding at ambient CO2 levels. Overall, this study suggests there may be potential impacts to freshwater fishes alarm cue behaviors following CO2 exposure, but these responses may be species-specific and will likely be abated should the CO2 stressor be removed."

Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix Valenciennes in Cuvier & Valenciennes, 1844), an invasive planktivorous fish, has spread throughout Midwestern rivers and currently threatens the Great Lakes. Because silver carp remove plankton and other particles from the water column, they may compete with mussels for food resources. This would be among the first examples of a direct competitive interaction between fish and mussels. To examine the potential for competition, a 30 day tank experiment was performed with 2 year old fatmucket mussels (Lampsilis siliquoidea Barnes, 1823) and age-1 silver carp in three treatments: fatmucket only, silver carp only and fatmucket + silver carp. All tanks were given a commercial algal-based diet daily and dry mass of suspended particles (an estimate of available food) and NH4, NO3 and NO2 concentrations were quantified every 5 days to track food availability and changes in nutrients. Initial and final silver carp total length (mm) and mass (g), and fatmucket length (mm), height (mm) and surface area (cm(2)) were measured. Survival was 100% over the test duration for both species. Fatmucket grew less in the fatmucket + silver carp treatment, whereas silver carp growth was undetectable regardless of treatment. Fatmucket also exhibited increased movement in the presence of silver carp. Suspended particles did not differ among treatments. Dissolved nitrogen concentrations were higher in the silver carp treatments, suggesting that silver carp increase nutrient availability in aquatic systems. Overall, the slower growth rates observed in the fatmucket + silver carp treatment compared with the mussel-only treatment suggest exploitative competition between invasive planktivorous silver carp and fatmucket, and this competition may contribute to additional stress on already imperilled mussels."

Species with plasticity in their reproductive biology are likely to be successful as an invasive species, as they can adapt their reproductive effort during various phases of a biological invasion. Silver carp (Hypophthalmicthys molitrix), an invasive cyprinid in North America, display wide variation in reproductive strategies across both their native and introduced ranges, though the specifics of silver carp reproduction in the Illinois River have not been established. We assessed reproductive status using histological and endocrinological methods in silver carp between April and October 2018, with additional histological data from August to October 2017. Here, we show that female silver carp are batch spawners with asynchronous, indeterminate oocyte recruitment, while male silver carp utilize a determinate pattern of spermatogenesis which ceases in the early summer. High plasma testosterone levels in females could be responsible for regulating oocyte development. Our results suggest that silver carp have high spawning activity in the early summer (May-June), but outside of the peak spawning period, female silver carp can maintain spawning-capable status by adjusting rates of gametogenesis and atresia in response to environmental conditions, while males regress their gonads as early as July. The results of this study are compared to reports of silver carp reproduction in other North American rivers as well as in Asia."	"10.1093/biolre/ioz207"	"internal-pdf://1071153220/Tucker-2020.pdf"

However, quantifying the effects of invasive species in large ecosystems is challenging. Measuring changes in basal resources (i.e., phytoplankton) at an ecosystem scale is an important and potentially translatable response vital to the understanding of how introduced species influence ecosystems. In this study, we analyzed patterns of early summer chlorophyll-a in a large-river reservoir in response to invasion of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). We used 25 years of ecological data from a 30-km reach of Kentucky Lake collected before and after silver carp establishment. We found significant decreases in chlorophyll-a within certain reservoir habitats since establishment of silver carp. Additionally, environmental and biological drivers of phytoplankton production showed no significant differences before and after invasion. These results suggest seasonal, and habitat-specific consumptive effects of invasive silver carp on an important basal food web resource. Further, our results convey the utility of long-term quantitative biological and physiochemical data in understanding ecosystem responses to elements of global change (i.e., species invasions). Importantly, the observed changes in the basal food web resource of Kentucky Lake may apply to other ecosystems facing invasion by silver carp (e.g., Laurentian Great Lakes). Our study offers insight into the mechanisms by which silver carp may influence ecosystems and furthers our understanding of invasive omnivores."

However, the role of endozoochory in the context of invasive species is considered less often. Throughout the United States, Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) are prolific invaders that often alter food web structure of recipient ecosystems through the consumption of basal resources. Despite the biogeochemical and food web effects of Silver Carp, there is limited understanding of plankton prey survival after Silver Carp consumption and digestion, and even less known about the ecological effects of selective diets and potential survival. In this study, we quantify hindgut contents of Silver Carp collected from Kentucky Lake, Kentucky, Tennessee River Valley, United States. We found the majority (83%) of phytoplankters within hindguts of Silver Carp showed little digestion prior to egestion. Our study suggests digestion limitations of Silver Carp may have important ecological implications for invaded environments. These results may be applicable in understanding how this rapidly spreading invasive fish can influence food web dynamics and biogeochemical cycles pertinent to toxic algal blooms within recently invaded ecosystems, and forecasting invasion in the near future."

Although habitat fragmentation may be detrimental to native fish species, it might act as an effective and economical barrier for controlling the spread of invasive species in riverine systems. Various technologies have been proposed as potential fish deterrents at locks and dams to reduce bigheaded carp (i.e., silver carp and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys spp.)) range expansion in the Upper Mississippi River (UMR). Lock and Dam (LD) 15 is infrequently at open-river condition (spillway gates completely open; hydraulic head across the dam <0.4 m) and has been identified as a potential location for fish deterrent implementation. We used acoustic telemetry to evaluate paddlefish passage at UMR dams and to evaluate seasonal and diel movement of paddlefish and bigheaded carp relative to environmental conditions and lock operations at LD 15. We observed successful paddlefish passage at all dams, with the highest number of passages occurring at LDs 17 and 16. Paddlefish residency events in the downstream lock approach of LD 15 occurred more frequently and for longer durations than residency events of bigheaded carp. We documented upstream passages completed by two individual paddlefish through the lock chamber at LD 15, and a single bighead carp completed upstream passage through the lock chamber during two separate years of this study. We identified four bigheaded carp and 19 paddlefish that made upstream passages through the spillway gates at LD 15 during this study. The majority of the upstream passages through the spillway gates for both species occurred during open river conditions. When hydraulic head was approximately 1-m or greater, we observed these taxa opt for upstream passage through the lock chamber more often than the dam gates. In years with infrequent open-river condition, a deterrent placed in the downstream lock approach may assist in meeting the management goal of reducing upstream passage of bigheaded carps but could also potentially affect paddlefish residency and passage. Continued study to understand the effects of deterrents on native fish could be beneficial for implementing an integrated bigheaded carp control strategy. Understanding fish behavior at UMR dams is a critical information need for river managers as they evaluate potential tools or technologies to control upstream expansion of bigheaded carp in the UMR."

The large filter-feeding fish, which are known to jump from the water and hit anglers, threaten aquatic food webs as well as the $7 billion Great Lakes fishery. But, for the past decade, the invading front has not moved past Kankakee. A new study, led by scientists at the University of Illinois, suggests that Chicago's water pollution may be a contributing to this lack of upstream movement. Cory Suski, associate professor in the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences and co-author of the study, de- scribes the water coming down from the Chicago Area Waterway as a toxic soup. However, a lot of those chemicals go away near Kankakee, nobody is quite sure why. They might degrade or settle out, or the Kankakee River might dilute them, but for whatever reason, there is a stark change in water quality at that point. The researchers think the fish stop at Kankakee because they are responding negatively to compounds in the water flowing downstream from Chicago. They formulated their hypothesis after reading a 2017 water quality report from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). USGS researchers tracked changes in water chemistry in a single pocket of water as it moved from Chicago downstream through the Illinois River. Right near Kankakee, many of the pharmaceuticals, volatile organic compounds, and wastewater indicators dropped off the charts. Suski says many of these compounds have been shown in other studies to induce avoidance behaviours in fish, but his team did not look at behaviour. Instead, they examined gene expression patterns in blood and liver samples from silver carp at three locations along the Illinois River: at Kankakee, approximately 10 miles downstream near Morris, and 153 miles downstream near Havana. They found large differences in gene expression patterns between the Kankakee fish and the two downstream populations. Fish near Kankakee were turning on genes associated with clearing out toxins and turning off genes related to DNA repair and protective measures. Basically, their livers were working overtime and detoxifying pathways were very active. This did not occur in either of the downstream po- pulations. Suski stresses that his study was not designed to demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship between water pollution and silver carp movement, but the results hint at a compelling answer to a decade-old mystery. The researchers hope to follow up to show how the fish are metabolizing the pollutants, which will give them a better under- standing of which compounds are having the biggest effects. Regardless of which specific pollutants may be responsible for stopping silver carp, if that hypothesis is later proven, the results could have interesting implications for management."

The mineral nutrition value of cans was also determined to take into account the changes in estimated daily intake (EDI) of elements during storage and then clustered by principal component analysis (PCA). Results revealed that the reduction of trace elements in brine was higher than in other filling media due to formation of insoluble metal hydroxide. No changes were detected in the mineral content of cans after 1-year storage in comparison to fresh cans, while the content and daily intake of zinc, iron, calcium, copper, and sodium were significantly decreased in all filling media after 3, 5, and 7 years of storage. The first-order reaction model was detected for reduction of mineral contents in filling medium.

Main stem navigation dams on the upper Mississippi River, long considered a deterrent to fish migration, may slow or prevent the spread of invasive fish species. As discharge increases, hydraulic head (i.e., difference between upstream elevation and downstream elevation) at these navigation dams decreases, which is believed to allow for easier fish passage. We used acoustic telemetry to investigate the occurrence, frequency, and timing of bigheaded carp passage of upper Mississippi River dams, along with factors related to successful dam passage. During 2013 through 2017, adult silver carp (H. molitrix), bighead carp (H. nobilis) and their hybrids (N = 358) were tracked throughout the upper Mississippi River. A total of 1078 dam passages by bigheaded carps (N = 158) were observed past 15 dams. Seventy-eight percent of dam passages occurred during April through July. Cox proportional hazards regression models indicated that both upstream and downstream dam passages by these species were strongly affected by hydraulic head height at the dam and water temperature, with dam passages increasing as hydraulic head decreased and water temperature increased. A few dams rarely experience low hydraulic head and passages of those dams by bigheaded carps were rare. This information can be used by managers to develop strategies (e.g., placement of deterrent technologies, targeted removal efforts) to slow the spread of these invasive species."

Controlling bigheaded carp is a priority of fisheries managers and one area of focus involves developing acoustic deterrents to prevent upstream migration. For an acoustic deterrent to be effective however, the hearing ability of bigheaded carp must be characterized. A previous study showed that bigheaded carp detected sound up to 3 kHz but this range is narrower than what has been reported for other ostariophysans. Therefore, silver and bighead carp frequency detection was evaluated in response to 100 Hz to 9 kHz using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). AEPs were recorded from 100 Hz to 5 kHz. The lowest thresholds were at 500 Hz for both species (silver carp threshold: 80.6 ± 3.29 dB re 1 μPa SPLrms, bighead carp threshold: 90.5 ± 5.75 dB re 1 μPa SPLrms; mean ± SD). These results provide fisheries managers with better insight on effective acoustic stimuli for deterrent systems, however, to fully determine bigheaded carp hearing abilities, these results need to be compared with behavioral assessments."

This study examined the phonotaxic response of the bighead carp (H. nobilis) to pure tones (500-2000 Hz) and playbacks of broadband sound from an underwater recording of a 100 hp outboard motor (0.06-10 kHz) in an outdoor concrete pond (10 x 5 x 1.2 m) at the U.S. Geological Survey Upper Midwest Environmental Science Center in La Crosse, WI. The number of consecutive times the fish reacted to sound from alternating locations at each end of the pond was assessed. Bighead carp were relatively indifferent to the pure tones with median consecutive responses ranging from 0 to 2 reactions away from the sound source. However, fish consistently exhibited significantly (P < 0.001) greater negative phonotaxis to the broadband sound (outboard motor recording) with an overall median response of 20 consecutive reactions during the 10 min trials. In over 50% of broadband sound tests, carp were still reacting to the stimulus at the end of the trial, implying that fish were not habituating to the sound. This study suggests that broadband sound may be an effective deterrent to bighead carp and provides a basis for conducting studies with wild fish.

To optimize potential optical deterrents, it is necessary to understand the visual sensitivity of the fishes. Dark‐adapted H. molitrix and H. nobilis were found to possess broad visual sensitivity between 470 to 620 nm with peak spectral sensitivity at 540 nm for H. molitrix and 560 nm in H. nobilis. To assess the effect of a strobe light on vision, dark‐adapted H. molitrix, H. nobilis and common carp Cyprinus carpio, were exposed to three different 5 s trains (100, 200, or 500 ms on–off flashes) of white light and the recovery of visual sensitivity was determined by measuring the b‐wave amplitude of the electroretinogram (ERG). For all species, the longest recoveries were observed in response to the 500 ms flash trains (H. molitrix mean ± SE = 702.0 ± 89.8 s; H. nobilis 648.0 ± 116.0 s; C. carpio 480 ± 180.0 s). The results suggest that strobe lights can temporarily depress visual sensitivity, which may render optical barriers less effective."

The present study aimed: to assess the breadth of FISK applications and the confidence (certainty) levels associated with the decision-support tool’s 49 questions and its ability to distinguish between taxa of low-to-medium and high risk of becoming invasive, and thus provide climate-specific, generalised, calibrated thresholds for risk level categorisation; and to identify the most potentially invasive freshwater fish species on a global level. The 1973 risk assessments were carried out by 70 + experts on 372 taxa (47 of the 51 species listed as invasive in the Global Invasive Species Database www.iucngisd.org/gisd/), which in decreasing order of importance belonged to the taxonomic Orders Cypriniformes, Perciformes, Siluriformes, Characiformes, Salmoniformes, Cyprinodontiformes, with the remaining ≈ 8% of taxa distributed across an additional 13 orders. The most widely-screened species (in decreasing importance) were: grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella, common carp Cyprinus carpio, rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva. Nine ‘globally’ high risk species were identified: common carp, black bullhead Ameiurus melas, round goby Neogobius melanostomus, Chinese (Amur) sleeper Perccottus glenii, brown bullhead Ameiurus nebulosus, eastern mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki, largemouth (black) bass Micropterus salmoides, pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus and pikeperch Sander lucioperca.

Hypophthalmichthys molitrix"	"Expansion of non-native fish have caused ecological and economic damage and can negatively impact native fish populations. Current research on deterrent technologies for bighead Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and silver carp H. molitrix have primarily focused on reducing upstream movement in large river lock approaches. However, there is also interest in excluding carp from smaller-scale locations. A water control structure at Emiquon Preserve, Lewistown, Illinois, USA reconnected the Preserve’s wetland lakes to the Illinois River, and is a pinch point that site managers seek to deter immigration of non-native fishes without restricting native fish movement. One possible deterrent strategy that was evaluated within the water control structure in 2017 was the use of a 100 hp boat motor acoustic stimulus. Two underwater speakers were installed in each of two culverts to discourage fish movement though the water control structure. Fish passage was monitored using a series of passive integrated transponder (PIT) antennas in a confined study area. A combination of 176 fish consisting of seven different species (native and non-native) were implanted with PIT tags and relocated downstream of the water control structure. Over 2 days of periodic playback of the acoustic stimulus, 29% of tagged silver carp that were detected crossed though the active underwater speaker array. The acoustic treatment did not significantly reduce silver carp or native centrarchid passage through the culverts. However, numerous silver carp were observed jumping out of the acoustically active culvert at the onset of the stimulus. The acoustic stimulus, especially the frequencies to which silver carp are most sensitive to (< 2000 Hz), rapidly attenuated in the water control structure (water depth 0.55–0.38 m). Depth related attenuation observed in and around the water control structure may have reduced the efficacy of the acoustic fish deterrent system at this location."

LFs effectively resisted H2O2-induced oxidative injury in HEK-293 cells by reducing cellular reactive oxygen species levels, protecting cellular antioxidant enzyme systems, inhibiting cell apoptosis and necrosis, and diminishing loss of mitochondrial-membrane potential. Among the TLs, PLs surpassed NLs in conferring antioxidant activities.

The results demonstrated that the addition of SCMH could attenuate the freeze damage of yeast cells, prevent the degradation or loss of soluble proteins, and increase the composition and absolute content of fatty acids.

To elucidate the role of ammonia, we conducted 96-h acute toxicity tests as well as a whole-ecosystem chronic toxicity test for one year in ten 600-m(2) ponds. Three common cyprinids, silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix Val. (H.m.), bighead carp Aristichthys nobilis Richardson (Am.), and gibel carp Carassius auratus gibelio Bloch (C.g.), were used as test organisms. The 96-h LC50 values of un-ionized ammonia (NH3) for H.m.,A.n., and Cg. were 035, 033, and 0.73 mg L-1, respectively. In the ponds, annual mean NH3 ranged between 0.01 and 0.54 mg L-1, with 4 ponds having a NH3 higher than the LC50 of A.n. (lowest LC50 in this study). No fish were found dead in the high-nitrogen ponds, but marked histological changes were found in livers and gills. Despite these changes, the specific growth rate of H.m. and An. increased significantly with NH3. Our pond results suggest that fish might be more tolerant to high ammonia concentrations in natural aquatic ecosystems than under laboratory conditions. Our finding from field experiments thus suggests that the existing regulatory limits for reactive nitrogen (NH3) established from lab toxicity tests might be somewhat too high at the ecosystem conditions. Field-scale chronic toxicity tests covering full life histories of fish and other aquatic organisms are therefore encouraged in order to optimize determination of the effects of ammonia in natural environments.

In particular, the relative role of disparate propagule sources and genetic adaptation through postintroduction hybridization has remained largely unexplored. To add resolution to this paradox, we investigate the genetic architecture responsible for the invasion of two invasive Asian carp species, bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (H. molitrix) (bigheaded carps) that experience extensive hybridization in the Mississippi River Basin (MRB). We sequenced the genomes of bighead and silver carps (similar to 1.08G bp and similar to 1.15G bp, respectively) and their hybrids collected from the MRB. We found moderate-to-high heterozygosity in bighead (0.0021) and silver (0.0036) carps, detected significantly higher dN/dS ratios of single-copy orthologous genes in bigheaded carps versus 10 other species of fish, and identified genes in both species potentially associated with environmental adaptation and other invasion-related traits. Additionally, we observed a high genomic similarity (96.3% in all syntenic blocks) between bighead and silver carps and over 90% embryonic viability in their experimentally induced hybrids. Our results suggest intrinsic genomic features of bigheaded carps, likely associated with life history traits that presumably evolved within their native ranges, might have facilitated their initial establishment of invasion, whereas ex-situ interspecific hybridization between the carps might have promoted their range expansion. This study reveals an alternative mechanism that could resolve one of the genetic paradoxes in biological invasions and provides invaluable genomic resources for applied research involving bigheaded carps."

Severe hypoxia stress can lead to damage and even death of silver carp. Therefore, it is very important to explore how silver carp adapt to and respond to hypoxia stress. MicroRNAs play an important role in a series of important life activities in organisms. In this study, the differentiallyexpressed miRNAs were screened from a mixed pool of liver, brain, heart and gill of silver carp under different levels of hypoxia stress by high-throughput sequencing. Our findings provided new insights to further study the miRNA regulatory mechanism and molecular characteristics of anoxic response in silver carp. Hypoxia is one of the serious stresses in fish culture, which can lead to physical and morphological changes, and cause injury and even death to fish. Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) is an important economic fish and widely distributed in China. MicroRNA is a kind of endogenous non-coding single-stranded small RNA, which is involved in cell development, and immune response and gene expression regulation. In this study, silver carp were kept in the closed containers for hypoxia treatment by spontaneous oxygen consumption. The samples of heart, brain, liver and gill were collected, and the total RNAs extracted separately from the four tissues were mixed in equal amounts according to the concentration. Afterwards, the RNA pool was constructed for high-throughput sequencing, and based on the small RNA sequencing, the differentially expressed microRNAs were identified. Furthermore, their target gene prediction and enrichment analyses were carried out. The results showed that a total of 229 known miRNAs and 391 putative novel miRNAs were identified, which provided valuable resources for further study on the regulatory mechanism of miRNAs in silver carp under hypoxia stress. The authors verified 16 differentially expressed miRNAs by qRT-PCR, and the results were consistent with small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq). The predicted target genes number of differentially expressed miRNAs was 25,146. GO and KEGG functional enrichment analysis showed that these target genes were mainly involved in the adaption of hypoxia stress in silver carp through biological regulation, catalytic activity and apoptosis. This study provides references for further study of interaction between miRNAs and target genes, and the basic data for the response mechanism under hypoxia stress in silver carp."

A high-density genetic linkage map was constructed by sequencing 198 individuals in a F-1 family of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) in this study. This genetic map spans a length of 2,721.07 cM with 3,134 SNPs distributed on 24 linkage groups (LGs). Comparative genomic mapping presented a high level of syntenic relationship between silver carp and zebrafish. We detected one major and nineteen suggestive QTL for 4 growth-related traits (body length, body height, head length and body weight) at 6, 12 and 18 months post hatch (mph), explaining 10.2 similar to 19.5% of phenotypic variation. All six QTL for growth traits of 12 mph generally overlapped with QTL for 6 mph, while the majority of QTL for 18 mph were identified on two additional LGs, which may reveal a different genetic modulation during early and late muscle growth stages. Four potential candidate genes were identified from the QTL regions by homology searching of marker sequences against zebrafish genome. Hepcidin, a potential candidate gene identified from a QTL interval on LG16, was significantly associated with growth traits in the analyses of both phenotype-SNP association and mRNA expression between small-size and large-size groups of silver carp. These results provide a basis for elucidating the genetic mechanisms for growth and body formation in silver carp, a world aquaculture fish."

However, simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers developed on H. molitrix genome level for genetic diversity analysis are limited. In this study, the distribution characteristics of SSRs in the assembled H. molitrix genome were analyzed, and new markers were developed to preliminarily evaluate the genetic diversity of the four breeding populations. A total of 368,572 SSRs were identified from the H. molitrix genome. The total length of SSRs was 6,492,076 bp, accounting for 0.77% of the total length of the genome sequence. The total frequency and total density were 437.73 loci/Mb and 7713.16 bp/Mb, respectively. Among the 2–6 different nucleotide repeat types, SSRs were dominated by di-nucleotide repeats (204,873, 55.59%), and AC/GT was the most abundant motif. The number of SSRs on each chromosome was positively correlated with the length. The 13 pairs of markers developed were used to analyze the genetic diversity of four cultivated populations in Hubei Province. The results showed that the genetic diversity of the four populations was low, and the ranges of alleles (Na), effective alleles (Ne), observed heterozygosity (Ho), and Shannon’s index information (I) were 3.538–4.462, 2.045–2.461, 0.392–0.450, and 0.879–0.954, respectively. Genetic variation occurs mainly among individuals within populations (95.35%). UPGMA tree and Bayesian analysis showed that four populations could be divided into two different branches. Therefore, the genome-wide SSRs were effectively in genetic diversity analysis on H. molitrix."	"10.3390/genes13071267"	"internal-pdf://3314215996/43VkN"

Therefore, understanding their reproductive traits and particularly in the context of hybridization with other cyprinids was of value to explain their rapid propagation as well as potential benefits for aquaculture due to their unique diet, behavior, growth potential, and tolerance to deteriorating environmental conditions in freshwater ecosystems. Distant hybridization is an effective tool to create different ploidy offspring with changed phenotypes and genotypes. In this study, we reported distant hybridization of female koi carp (Cyprinus carpio haematopterus, KOC, 2n = 100) x male bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, BIC, 2n = 48) and the spontaneous occurrence of two new "crucian" carp-like homodiploid fish (2nGCC-L; 2nCCC-L; 2n = 100), a new type of triploid hybrid (3nKB, 3n = 124), and a new type of tetraploid hybrid (4nKB, 4n = 148). The body color of 2nGCC-L and 2nCCC-L were gray and multicolor, respectively. Both phenotypes were similar to the crucian carp (Carassius auratus). The difference was that their heads were rounder than those of the crucian carp and they had higher backs. Compared with the KOC with two pairs of barbels and BIC without barbel, 2nGCC-L, 2nCCC-L, and 4nKB had no barbel, but 3nKB had one pair of barbels. Microsatellite patterns and 5S rDNA sequences confirmed that 2nGCC-L, 2nCCC-L, and 3nKB were of hybrid origin. In regard to feeding, KOC was omnivorous and BIC was a typical filter-feeder. However, the 2nGCC-L, 2nCCC-L, and 3nKB were omnivorous. The formation of four kinds of new offspring is a groundbreaking finding in fish genetic breeding and evolutionary biology."

Antioxidant ability, neurotoxicity, and thyroid hormones (THs) content were evaluated. In comparison with the control, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and the glutathione (GSH) activity were lower in silver carp exposed to 10 mu g/L Hg2+. The lowest catalase (CAT) activity was found in the 10 mu g/L Hg2+, while malondialdehyde (MDA) content was not significantly different among all groups.

In the 1 mu g/L Hg2+, the integrated biomarker response (IBR) index value was the highest. In summary, exposure to Hg could decrease the antioxidant ability, cause changes in neurotoxic parameters, and induce disorders of the thyroid hormone system in silver carp larvae.

In Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, recent hydrological changes driven by the operation of Three Gorges Dam (TGD) and drought have caused a drastic loss of fishery resources. In response, managers have planned to build a sluice at Poyang Lake's outlet to manage the lake's water level and, as the sluice will unavoidably limit the river-lake migration of many fishery species, managers have also proposed implementing stock enhancement programs and restricting fisheries to sustain fisheries in the lake. In this study, we built and implemented a Poyang Lake Ecopath with Ecosim model to evaluate effects of water level management, stock enhancement, and fishery restriction on biomass of the four major Chinese carps: grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), bighead carp (H. nobilis), and black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus), of which all are river-lake migratory and important to fisheries. Results showed that the total biomass of the four major Chinese carps could increase with increases in water level, increases in stocking biomass, and decreases in fishing pressure. However, even in the best management effort scenario (i.e., highest water level, highest stocking biomass, and no fishing), simulated total biomass of the four major Chinese carps was still 16% lower than the biomass estimate in 2000, three years before the operation of TGD. These results suggest that a combination of managing water level, stocking, and restricting fisheries can substantially offset negative effects of hydrological changes on the four major Chinese carps, but may not be enough to restore the biomass of the four major Chinese carps to high levels that had occurred before the operation of TGD, because of the blockage of river-lake connectivity by the Poyang Lake sluice."

As the world's busiest inland river in regard to shipping, little attention has been paid to underwater noise pollution. In 2017, the underwater noise level in 25 riverside locations along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River mainly at night time were investigated by using passive acoustic monitoring method. Approximately 88% and 40% of the sampled sites exhibit noise levels exceeding the underwater acoustic thresholds of causing responsiveness and temporary threshold shift, respectively, in cetacean. Noise pollution may impose a high impact on fish with physostomous swim bladders and Weberian ossicles, such as silver carp, bighead carp, goldfish and common carp, whereas it may affect fish with physoclistous swim bladders and without Weberian ossicles, such as lake sturgeon and paddlefish, to a lesser extent. Noise levels reductions of approximately 10 and 20 dB were observed in the middle and lower reaches, respectively, of the Yangtze River over the 2012 level. The green development mode of the ongoing construction of green shipping in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, including the development of green shipping lanes, ports, ships and transportation organizations, may account for the alleviated underwater noise pollution. Follow-up noise mitigation endeavors, such as the extension of ship speed restrictions and the study and implementation of the optimal navigation speed in ecologically important areas, are required to further reduce the noise level in the Yangtze River to protect local porpoises and fish."

Ground silver carp was diluted, and soluble proteins were separated by centrifugation and dried. The proximate composition (dry wt) of the protein powders averaged 82.42% protein, 3.25% lipid, and 14.50% ash. Average protein recovery yield was 11.78% with the better yields occurring at 20 degrees C (P < 0.05). Mineral profile revealed greater concentrations of Fe, Mg, P, and Na when compared to the initial homogenate. More saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids were recovered in the 4 degrees C powder and the least in the 40 degrees C powder (P < 0.05). Polyunsaturated fatty acids displayed a reverse trend, with the greatest concentration in the 40 degrees C powder and the least in the 4 degrees C powder (P < 0.05). The amino acid profile revealed that the protein powder met all FAO/WHO/UNO amino acid requirements for adults. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) revealed high amounts of low and medium molecular weight (MW) proteins (10-15 and 25-50 kDa, respectively). Two-dimensional (2-D) electrophoresis indicated that the low MW proteins possessed a neutral isoelectric point relative to that of the medium MW proteins. The protein powder was significantly less soluble (P < 0.05) than whey protein concentrate 80 at every pH tested (pH 3.0 to 11.0). Similar tendencies were seen when ionic strength was shifted (0.0 to 1.1 I; P < 0.05). Soluble protein powders derived from silver carp are nutrient rich and have physical characteristics resembling whey protein concentrate. Changes in process temperature had limited effects on protein powder composition. Practical ApplicationSoluble proteins contribute to 20 to 40% of fish protein and are soluble in neutral salt solutions. Much of the sarcoplasmic proteins are lost when they solubilize in processing water and are discarded similarly to how whey protein was once discarded during dairy processing. When government regulations on whey disposal were implemented, the dairy industry responded by repurposing the high-quality protein for human use and it is now a billion dollar industry.

The current northern invasion edge of Bigheaded Carp in the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) spans between Pools 14 and 20 because of limited passage at Lock and Dam (LD) 19. Mechanisms limiting adult Bigheaded Carp abundance above LD19 are unknown but may be due in part to lack of reproductive success influenced by adult abundance and environmental factors. Our objective was to investigate how relative adult biomass and river temperature and discharge affect maximum annual Bigheaded Carp larval production in the UMR using a Ricker stock-recruitment model. Adult Bigheaded Carp relative biomass (kg/h) was estimated annually with boat electrofishing and larvae were collected every 10 d between May and August 2014-2017 in Pools 14-20 in the UMR. Adult relative biomass ranged from 0.0 to 880.9 kg/h, whereas maximum annual larval densities ranged from 0.0 to 2,869.4 larvae/m(3). After accounting for variability among pools and years, the most supported linear Ricker stock-recruitment model indicated the number of recruits per spawner decreased with increasing adult relative biomass and increased with mean discharge. Our results highlight the importance of adult biomass and river discharge conditions for reproduction of Bigheaded Carp along leading edges of invasion. Management strategies that aim to maintain low adult abundance where reproduction is not yet occurring could help limit population increases via reproduction, whereas reducing high adult biomass (e.g., commercial harvest, barriers) may result in greater Bigheaded Carp reproductive output in the UMR."

Myosin from silver carp was dissolved in solutions at various pH (5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 8.0 and 9.0). Effects of pH on the particle size, intermolecular forces, and micro-morphology of myosin at low temperature were investigated. The structures of myosin assemblies were observed to be influenced by varying pH using the variations in the degree of protonation and surface charge state of myosin molecules. The low electrostatic repulsion in acidic conditions resulted in the assembly before unfolding of myosin, leading to a relatively high turbidity and UV absorption as well as a decreased solubility. Confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis showed that myosin assemblies with coarse filamentous structure were formed in acid conditions. In alkaline conditions, the increased electrostatic repulsion led to a higher rate of unfolding than assembly and exposure of more hydrophobic residues, as showed by increased S-0-ANS values and free SH contents. This relatively high rate of unfolding contributed to the formation of assemblies with a fine and ordered structure. At pH 7.0, the most active structure of myosin molecules was maintained as shown by the highest Ca2+-ATPase activity. Myosin assemblies with an ordered and uniform structure were obtained at pH 7.0."

Furthermore, the surface modification of ZnO/TiO2 NPs enhances the preservation properties of the chitosan coating. Practical Application In our previous study, in situ SiOx was found to improve antibacterial and preservation properties of chitosan coating, leading to extending shelf time of Sciaenops ocellatus. In order to further improve properties of chitosan coatings, we added nontoxic edible nano materials to the in situ SiOx chitosan coatings. In situ SiOx modified by ZnO/TiO2 NPs were synthesized, measured, and characterized in this study, and were applied for the preservation of silver carp fish balls. It could serve as a potential preservation material due to the increasing mechanical preservation properties. Through the results, the ZnO/TiO2/SiOx-chitosan (ZTS-CS) coatings have potential as application in the food industry to guarantee food quality and extend shelf life of products."

Commercial cryoprotectant (8% w/w 1:1 sucrose-sorbitol blend, SuSo) and control (without cryoprotectant) groups were used for comparison. After six freeze-thaw cycles, the lowest actomyosin extractability, Ca2+-ATPase activity and total sulfhydryl content, along with the highest surface hydrophobicity of actomyosin, were observed in the control group (P < 0.05). On the contrary, the group with addition of 2 g of hydrolysate prepared by Protamex hydrolysis (PH-2) displayed the highest actomyosin extractability, Ca2+-ATPase activity and correspondingly, lowest surface hydrophobicity of actomyosin (P < 0.05). Total sulfhydryl content of actomyosin and textural properties of heat-set surimi gels were similar between samples with PH-2 and those with SuSo (P > 0.05). Differences in molecular weight distribution, total and free amino acid compositions between the hydrolysates prepared by Protamex and Alcalase hydrolysis were possible reasons attributing to their variable cryoprotective effects on freeze-thawed surimi. Results from this study clearly support that hydrolysate prepared by Protamex hydrolysis at an appropriate amount could serve as an effective cryoprotectant without increasing the sweetness of surimi products. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the hydrolysates follow a different cryoprotection mechanism compared to SuSo (sucrose-sorbitol blend)."	"10.3390/app9030563"	"internal-pdf://1259267993/mTGaB"

The extent of pollution carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks of aquatic products were evaluated by single factor pollution index (Pi), comprehensive pollution index (MPI), and various health risk assessment models. The results showed the following concentration ranges (means) of heavy metals in aquatic products in fresh weight:Cr 0.031~0.264 (0.131) mg·kg-1, Ni 0.077~0.742 (0.170) mg·kg-1, Cu 0.199~22.575 (2.318) mg·kg-1, Zn 3.422~36.764 (7.939) mg·kg-1, As 0.112~4.192 (0.339) mg·kg-1, Cd 0.004~1.269 (0.095) mg·kg-1, Hg 0.012~0.048 (0.026) mg·kg-1, Pb 0.028~0.253 (0.096) mg·kg-1. Compared with different aquatic products, the metal concentrations in fish and shrimp samples were within the quality safety limits, but the As and Cd concentrations of shellfish slightly exceeded the corresponding limits. The single factor pollution index of the extent of heavy metal pollution of aquatic products was in the order Cd > As > Pb > Hg > Cr > Zn > Cu. The MPI values showed that the degree of pollution of different aquatic products was shellfish (1.038) > shrimp (0.353) > fish (0.101~0.292). The heavy metal residues in different fishes were mainly attributed to their different feeding habits, living environment, and accumulation ability to specific heavy metals. In health risk assessment, the order of TTHQ (Total target hazard quotient) of aquatic products was as follows:shellfish > shrimps > Eleotridae > catfish > crucians > Culter alburnus > perch > mrigal carp > carp > sharpbelly > tilapia > silver carp > Gungdong bream > dace > grass carp > Barbel chub > bighead fish. The TTHQ of complex heavy metals was more than 1,and the contribution rate of As was the highest with an average contribution rate of 51.7%. Thus, there is a certain risk of carcinogenesis associated with edible shellfish."	"10.13254/j.jare.2019.0187"	"internal-pdf://0156953926/68eXC"

Here, we used otolith microchemistry of Silver Carp from the Kansas River to reconstruct environmental histories as a means to assess the proportions of resident and transient individuals. Silver Carp within the Kansas River were predominantly residents with the majority of reproduction coming from within the Kansas River itself. These results suggest removal efforts in the Kansas River may be effective means of managing this invasive fish species. Transient individuals exhibited short durations of signatures indicative of the Missouri River (mean percent of data points for adults 10% and juveniles 36%), suggesting movements into the Missouri River were brief.

However, there is a paucity of information concerning Silver Carp in the Missouri River basin, especially in tributaries. Little is known about how Silver Carp function in these tributaries or how connectivity with a main-stem river can influence population demographics within either system. The Kansas River is a tributary to the Missouri River and has multiple physical anthropogenic barriers creating varying levels of connectivity within the system, as well as with the Missouri River. These varying levels of connectivity, or lack thereof, provide a unique opportunity to examine population demographics in river segments separated by barriers. We collected Silver Carp from upstream and downstream of the first two barriers on the Kansas River in the summers of 2018 and 2019. No Silver Carp were captured upstream of a hydropower dam at river kilometer 84 but were found upstream of a water diversion weir at river kilometer 24. Catch rates of adult Silver Carp were lower in the reach above the weir, but Silver Carp caught in this reach exhibited greater growth rates than Silver Carp captured below the weir. Catch rates of juveniles were also lower in the reach above the weir. Limited connectivity within the Kansas River via the water diversion weir could influence size structure and catch rates of Silver Carp captured above and below the weir. Lack of juveniles above the weir indicates that reproduction may be limited in this reach, and river conditions below the weir may be more suitable for rearing juvenile Silver Carp. This information is important for understanding Silver Carp population demographics across a range of river environments, providing critical information for the development and implementation of broadscale control plans."

Lock and Dam 19 (LD19) is a high-head dam on the UMR that delineates downriver areas where bigheaded carps are well established from upriver pools where these species are less abundant and evidence of reproduction and recruitment are limited. Principal natal environments supporting recruitment of emerging bigheaded carp populations in the UMR are unknown. The objectives of this study were to (1) infer environments occupied during early-life stages by bigheaded carps collected in UMR Pools 19-21 during 2013-2014 using otolith microchemistry and stable isotope analyses, and (2) use early-life environment assignments and capture location to identify individuals that passed through LD19. Differences in multivariate water chemistry signatures (Sr:Ca, Ba:Ca and O-18) among the UMR, its tributaries, and the Missouri and Middle Mississippi rivers enabled development of a classification model for inferring early-life environment of bigheaded carps. Multiple sources of recruits, including from tributaries, have contributed to upriver expansion of bigheaded carps in the UMR. Sustainable control of bigheaded carps upstream of LD19 will likely require efforts to control local recruitment and immigration from downriver. The frequency of bigheaded carps collected in Pool 19 that were downstream of LD19 during early life suggests that bigheaded carps upstream of LD19 still predominantly consisted of immigrants from downriver during 2013-2014. Otolith chemistry provides an approach for assessing the extent to which changes in abundance of bigheaded carps upstream of LD19 are associated with local recruitment or immigration from downriver."

The objectives of this study were to identify trends in the fish communities and to characterize the community trajectory (i.e., directional or nondirectional) of the Illinois River, a large tributary to the Mississippi River, using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Although NMDS has been used to evaluate community trajectory in multivariate space over time in smaller rivers, there has been less attention given to larger rivers, which may exhibit different dynamics. To evaluate changes in large river fish communities, we used a long-term electrofishing monitoring dataset (1957-2013) that includes fish abundance data from six reaches of the Illinois River, Illinois, U.S.A. Temporal changes in Illinois River fish communities were evident in NMDS ordinations. Larger changes in NMDS ordinations were associated with improving water quality conditions, whereas the invasion of bigheaded carp (silver carp Hypophthalimichtys molitrix and bighead carp H. nobilis) produced smaller and less variable changes. Across all six reaches of the Illinois River, the trajectory of fish communities was directional in multivariate space, with no return to an initial or predisturbance condition. Community trajectory in larger and more heavily-modified rivers may be substantially different and more complex than that of smaller and less heavily modified rivers."

Therefore, susceptibility of a habitat to invasion is influenced by the capacity of native predators to regulate invasive species through consumption. Closely related predators often share similar characteristics (e.g., odors or body morphometry), and prey species capable of expressing generalized behavioral responses to predators with similar characteristics may increase their chances for survival. Here, we examined how naive juvenile silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), an invasive Asian carp, respond to three predator odors from predators commonly found in Midwestern lakes and rivers of the USA. We tested two congeneric species of bass (largemouth Micropterus salmoides and smallmouth M. dolomieu bass) and one outgroup, longnose gar (Lepisosteus osseus). Additionally, we tested how silver carp conditioned to recognize the odor of one group, largemouth bass, responded to the predator odors of the congeneric species and the outgroup. We found that juvenile silver carp showed no innate response to any of the three predator odors. Additionally, although they could be conditioned to recognize predator odors from largemouth bass, they were unable to generalize predator odors to smallmouth bass or longnose gar odor. These results suggest that invasive species could be less likely to persist in environments with diverse predator communities than environments of equal densities with uniform predator communities and that future studies should continue to explore this area as well as focus on understanding dynamics in predator-prey interactions of invasive species."

However, the two species of bigheaded carps respond to conspecific chemicals differently. Silver carp increase distance among individuals, whereas bighead carp reduce distance between individuals. Both show a reduction in activity after chemical application. Though both species recognize conspecific alarm cues, bighead carp exhibit similar fright patterns when exposed to alarm chemicals of silver carp, yet no behavioral responses were detected in silver carp when exposed to alarm chemicals of bighead carp.

The level to which native piscivores are consuming this novel prey item is unclear. Therefore, the goal of this research was to assess the diets of native piscivores collected in Pool 26 and the Open River reach of the Mississippi River. Using diet contents and catch rates of small fishes, selection or avoidance could be determined for predator prey interactions. Then a controlled laboratory experiment was conducted to determine if common predators [White Bass Morone chrysops and Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede, 1802)] would select for or against this novel prey in the presence of two native prey fish [Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum (Lesueur, 1818) and Emerald Shiner Notropis atherinoides]. Understanding how predator-prey interactions occur in a controlled laboratory experiment may provide insight to trends observed in the field. The majority of native piscivores appeared to be avoiding Silver Carp in both reaches and selecting native prey fishes. The order in which prey fish were consumed by both predators showed significant avoidance of Silver Carp.

The results of SDS-PAGE and FT-IR analysis showed that ASC and PSC were similar to those of the standard type I collagen. CD indicated that the triple helical structure of both ASC and PSC were still retained. And the transition from triple helix to random coil of ASC and PSC were 34.26 degrees C and 34.47 degrees C, respectively. For the first time, the collagen yields of silver carp scales were calculated. Meanwhile, their composition, properties and structure were characterized. These results may offer theoretical support for the development of silver carp scales related to reusing technology to control waste."

This study collected 410 samples of five wild freshwater fishes at different trophic levels from middle and eastern China. Concentrations of eight trace elements, chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) and stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were determined in dorsal muscle of fishes. Spatially, concentrations of trace elements were least in fishes from the Hai River Basin, while those in fishes from the Taihu Lake Basin were greatest The carnivorous topmouth culter and omnivorous common carp and crucian carp accumulated greater amounts of trace elements than did the planktivorous silver carp and bighead carp. Trophic biomagnification was for Cu, Fe and Zn, but not for Cr, Ni, As, Pb and Cd. Concentrations of As in 15 muscle samples (3.7%) from Taihu Lake Basin exceeded the guidelines (1.0 mg/kg, wet mass) provided by FAO/WHO (2014), while the total target hazard quotient (TTHQ) values were <1.0, indicating no obvious non-carcinogenic risks to humans that consume those fishes. However, people who consume larger amounts of fish products, or people who are vulnerable, such as pregnant women, children and people with poor health, might be at greater risk. Also, exposure to trace metals through other routes cannot be ignored. Accumulations of trace elements in Chinese freshwater fishes were affected by both geographical conditions and human activities.

However, the impacts of elevated temperature on fish reproduction are diverse in different regions. Previous studies have revealed that the spawning timing of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) in the Pearl River, in China, has changed over the past decade. However, few studies have explored the potential reasons, which are critical for determining fishing-moratorium periods and developing sustainable fisheries. The current study used discharge suitability index (DSI), temperature suitability index (TSI), correlation and time-series analyses to determine (i) the optimal discharge and temperature for silver carp spawning; (ii) relationships among the thermal regime, hydrological parameters, and spawning timing based on an 11-year time-series dataset. Our results indicated that the most suitable discharge and temperature for silver carp spawning were 13,000-15,000 m(3)/s and 25-26 degrees C, respectively. The start date of spawning fluctuated with a slight tendency to delay, while the spawning peak and end date obviously occurred earlier during the study period. Correlation analyses suggested that the increasing average temperature between January and March likely caused the initial spawning delay. Moreover, elevated temperatures in August and September probably promoted the anticipated end of silver carp spawning. However, increases in discharge did not significantly correlate with the start of spawning but were significantly and positively correlated with the spawning peak. These results indicated that elevated temperatures shorten the spawning period of silver carp in the Pearl River. Moreover, the initial spawning of silver carp seems to be triggered by temperature rather than changes in discharge; flow pulses can probably create more suitable spawning niches for H. molitrix. This study enhances our understanding of the effect of warming on fish reproduction in subtropical regions.</p>"	"10.3389/fmars.2021.708109"	"internal-pdf://0650242523/Xia-2021.pdf"

In order to understand the changes of fish assemblage structure in the process of ecological stocking and effectively, the existing fish community in Daye Lake which was divided into 9 sites was evaluated in the summer of 2019 and 2020, and fish resources were investigated by traditional fishing and eDNA metabarcoding technology. The results showed that 33 species belonging to 18 genera, 6 families and 4 orders of fish were investigated in Daye Lake based on traditional fishing methods. Among them, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Hypophthalmichthys nobilis were the dominant species in Daye Lake all year round, and the dominant group was omnivorous, middle-lower fish. And the fish communities at the same point at different times were similar, the separation degree of fish communities was relatively high among different locations. Based on eDNA metabarcoding technology, the mitochondrial COI (cytochrome oxidase I) and 12S rRNA gene regions of eDNA were amplified respectively. A total of 10 species of freshwater lake fish were detected, of which 7 were detected together with traditional methods. Alpha and Beta diversity analysis showed that GJQ had the lowest species diversity, DW and LJH had the highest species diversity, and the biodiversity of adjacent sites was relatively similar. This study proved that ecological stocking will not have a great impact on the diversity of fish populations in lakes. At the same time, it proved the effectiveness of eDNA metabarcoding technology in fish diversity investigation."

Here, this study aims to develop a colloidal gold immunochromatographic strip based on gold-labeled microwells to screen the residues of FQs on site. Materials and methods The Protein A Magarose Beads affinity chromatography method was adopted to purify the ascites against FQs. By using a strategy of heterologous coating antigen, different coating antigens are applied to detect FQs. The gold-labeled microwell immunochromatographic assay was used to improve the sensitivity of the test strip by the advanced reaction of antigen and antibody. Results The antibodies were verified to be of high purity up to 99%, and the titer reached 1:1 024 000. The combination (enoxacin-OVA and the antibody) detected the 4 banned FQs (pefloxacin, PEF; norfloxacin, NOR; lomefloxacin, LOM; ofloxacin, OFL) with the 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50) values ranging from 1.3 to 2.1 ng/mL and cross-reactions ranging from 67.3% to 106.1%. The analysis of spiked crucian carp, silver carp, grass carp, and shrimp samples showed that the limit of detection for PEF, NOR, LOM, and OFL was 4 mu g/kg. A comparative study with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) demonstrated that the assay provided an effective screening tool for the rapid detection of FQs residues. Conclusions The results indicated that the test strip can realize full coverage recognition of the 4 banned FQs and has good accuracy, specificity, reproducibility, and stability; therefore, they are more suitable for rapid detection of FQs in aquatic products."

The routine metabolic rate (RMR), gill surface area (GSA), ventilation frequency (VF), red blood cell surface area (S-RBC), and metabolic rate (MRRBC) were determined in silver carp, and their mass-scaling exponents were analyzed at 10 and 25 degrees C. These results showed that body mass and temperature independently affected the RMR, GSA, and VF, suggesting constant scaling exponents of RMR (0.772), GSA (0.912), and VF (-0.282) with changing temperature. The RMR at 25 degrees C was 2.29 times higher than that at 10 degrees C, suggesting increased metabolic demand at a higher temperature. The results showed that the RMR increased, while the scaling exponents of RMR, GSA, and VF remained unchanged with increasing temperature. These results support the view that the scaling of oxygen supply capacity importantly affects metabolic scaling. The S-RBC did not change with either temperature or body mass. However, the MRRBC increased by 5.48 times from 10 to 25 degrees C but did not change with body mass. As the scaling exponents of RMR did not change between temperatures, the results indicate that no obvious link exists between the scaling of both the cell size and cell metabolic rate and the metabolic scaling of silver carp."

In this study, we focused on the effects of TDCIPP on the growth and oxidative stress of an important commercial fish species in China, silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). Fish larvae was exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations (0.05, 0.5, 5 and 50 mu g/L) of TDCIPP for 7, 14 and 28 days. Simultaneously, the transcription levels of genes associated with the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor (GH/IGF) axis and the antioxidative enzymes were examined.

The observation evidenced the time-and dose-dependent growth inhibitions caused by TDCIPP on silver carp larvae. Exposure to TDCIPP also decreased the contents of GH and IGF1 in fish attended by significant down-regulation of gh and igf1. Moreover, TDCIPP up-regulated the expression of cat, sod1 and gstt followed by an increase of the activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH), but the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were decreased.

Understanding the mechanism by which the environment impacts the gut microbial communities of aquatic animals is crucial for assessing and managing aquatic ecosystem health. Here, we proposed a simplified framework for the colonization and dynamics of gut microbial communities. Then, to quantify the colonization of environmental microbes in the wild fish gut, the current study used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to obtain the structure of the water environmental microbial community and the gut microbial community in 10 wild fish populations (Leiocassis crassilabris, Leiocassis longirostris, Pelteobagrus vachelli, Silurus asotus, Siniperca chuatsi, Coilia brachygnathus, Aristichthys nobilis, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Coreius heterodon, and Xenocypris argentea) from the Wuhan section of the Yangtze River, and the relationship of these microbial communities was analyzed. The results identified that in most individuals, approximately 80% of gut microbes [at the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level] were shared with the water environmental microbial community (except for individuals of Siniperca chuatsi and Coilia brachygnathus, approximately 74%). In approximately 80% of individuals, more than 95% of microbial species (OTUs) in the gut were transient. For fish species, more than 99% of microbial species (OTUs) that were introduced into the gut were transient. Nearly 79% of OTUs and 89% of species of water environmental microbes could be introduced into the fish gut. Driven by the introduction of transient microbes, fishes with similar feeding habits had similar gut microbial communities. The results indicated that for adult wild fishes, most gut microbiota were transient from the environmental microbiota that were related to fish feeding habits. We therefore encourage future research to focus on environmental microbiota monitoring and management to promote the better conservation of aquatic animals. It was important to note that, because of various influence factors, interspecific differences and individual variations on gut microbial community characteristics, the quantification of gut microbes in the current work was approximate rather than accurate. We hope that more comparable research could be conducted to outline the quantitative characteristics of the relationship between gut microbial community and aquatic environment microbial community as soon as possible."

With the increase in anchovy mince content, the brightness and whiteness of the blended systems decreased gradually. When the ratio of anchovy mince to silver carp surimi was 10/90, the sensory evaluation score of the blended system was the highest and the bitterness score the lowest. Under this ratio, the relative contents of esters and aldehydes were the highest, while those of alcohols and ketones were the lowest. In conclusion, the optimum sample formulation contained a 10/90 ratio of anchovy mince to silver carp surimi."

The results showed that the highest concentrations of Zn (7.791 mg/kg), Pb (0.522 mg/kg), Cr (0.030 mg/kg), and Cu (0.767 mg/kg) were found in Tiangang Lake, Xifei Lake, Tiangang Lake and Baidang Lake, respectively. However, metals Ni, As, Hg, and Cd were not detected in all fish samples. In the fish species, the metal bioaccumulation ability was decreased with the following order: C. idellus > H. molitrix > H. nobilis > C. carpio. Furthermore, the target hazard quotient (THQ) was used to assess the health risk via fish consumption. The results indicated for co-exposure; C. idellus would pose a health risk to children at high exposure level (95th) as THQ value was higher than 1. It should be pointed out that Pb contributes most to the total THQs (the ratio was 88%); thus, the contamination of Pb should be paid more attention. This field investigation combined with health risk assessment would provide useful information on the heavy metal pollution in Anhui Province."

These fish species belong to the family Cyprinidae. In 2018, more than 18.5 million tons of Asian carp were produced globally. Asian carp can be used for producing surimi, a stabilized myofibrillar protein concentrate that can be made into a wide variety of products such as imitation crab sticks, fish balls, fish cakes, fish tofu, and fish sausage. Surimi is usually made from marine fish, but Asian carp have been widely used for surimi production in China. The quality of surimi is affected by various factors, including the processing methods and food additives, such as polysaccharides, protein, salt, and cryoprotectant. With an impending shortage of marine fish due to overfishing and depletion of fish stocks, Asian carp have a potential to serve as an alternative raw material for surimi products thanks to their high abundancy, less emissions of greenhouse gases from farming, desirable flesh color, and sufficient gel forming ability. The utilization of Asian carp in surimi production could also contribute to relieving the overflow of Asian carp in the United States."

Hypophthalmichthys molitrix"	"The influence of seasonality of the aquatic environment on food web has been notoriously understudied in empirical ecology. In this study, we focus on seasonal changes in one key attribute of a food web, the trophic level. We determine whether seasonal variations of fish trophic levels could be indicated by the change in food resources. Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (H. nobilis) were used to explore the responses of trophic levels of the filter-feeding fish to seasonal variations of food resources. Combined stable isotopic analysis and dietary analysis revealed that filter-feeding fish tended to have a higher trophic level in spring (May) and autumn (September and October). This may result from the abundant density of food resources (zooplankton and phytoplankton) and fish flexible foraging strategy, as we predicted that the trophic level follows the seasonality of food availability. Pearson’ correlation analysis and a structural equation model showed that seasonal variation of total phosphorus and water temperature could indirectly affect trophic levels of silver carp and bighead carp by mediating the abundance of phytoplankton and zooplankton directly and indirectly along the food chain. According to these findings, the seasonal variation of food resources could be an important indicator of the temporal dynamics of the food web trophic pattern in freshwater ecosystems."

Yangtze River"	"Four major species of Chinese carp, namely black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus), grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis), are important economic freshwater fish varieties in China. They primarily inhabit and breed in the Yangtze River. Unfortunately, the construction and operation of the Gezhouba Dam and the Three Gorges Dam have dramatically changed the hydrodynamic conditions in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, leading to a sharp decline in the reproduction rates of these carp. The egg abundance of the four species of carp downstream from the Three Gorges Dam reached 8.35 billion in 1965, but abundance during 2005-2012 was only 0.25 billion. One of the main reasons was that the hydrodynamic conditions of the spawning ground could not meet the four species’ breeding requirements. However, due to the limitations of traditional detection tools, the spawning characteristics of these four species of carp were still unclear. In this study, the ultrasonic telemetry and a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model were utilized to build the habitat suitability index (HSI) curves for the four species of carp. The habitat suitability model was then built based on HSI curves to assess spawning habitat quantity under different flow conditions. Finally, the habitat suitability model in the Yidu spawning ground was validated using 32 groups of sampling data in 2015 and 2017. The statistical results showed that the most suitable velocity ranged from 0.78 m/s to 0.93 m/s. The most suitable water depth ranged from 14.56 m to 16.35 m, and the most suitable Froude number ranged from 0.049 to 0.129. The habitat suitability model simulation results indicated that when the discharge was between 15,000 m3/s and 21,300 m3/s, the weighted usable area (WUA) values in both the Yidu and Zhicheng spawning grounds would remain at a high level. The validation results showed that most spawning activities occurred at a high level of WUA, and that the daily spawning egg numbers increased with the WUA value. Therefore, discharges of between 15,000 m3/s and 21,300 m3/s could be recommended as ecological operation target flows. We propose a feasible ecological operation scheme by setting the initial flow at 15,000 m3/s and maintaining the daily discharge increase at 1500 m3/s for 4 days."

Herein, the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were assessed in the gut of four major Chinese freshwater carp (i.e., silver carp, grass carp, bighead carp, and crucian carp) from food retail markets. Results show that the abundances of target ARGs (e.g., tetA, tetO, tetQ, tetW, sull, sulII, and bla(TEM-1)) and class 1 integrase (intl1) were in the range 9.4 x 10(-6) - 1.6 x 10(-1) and 6.7 x 10(-5) - 5.2 x 10(-2) gene copies per 16S rRNA gene, respectively.

The microbial taxa of fish gut could be partly separated among retail markets based on the PCA analysis. About 15.0% of the OTUs in fish gut were shared and 74.5% of the shared OTUs were identified as Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. These phyla may constitute the core microbiota in the guts of the four Chinese freshwater carp. The possible ARG hosts were revealed based on the network analysis, and the presence of pathogen-associated resistant genera in fish gut highlights the need to fully understand their potential human health risks.

Compared with KGM, deacetylated KGM (DKGM) weakened the water-holding capacity, but increased the gel strength of surimi gels. The storage modulus (G ') and loss modulus (G '') of surimi showed an upward trend, and the aggregation rate of surimi with DKGM changed. The number of ionic bonds of mixed surimi gels increased on the whole, but those of hydrogen bonds declined; a hydrophobic interaction was the main driving force, and improved with the DDs of DKGM. FT-IR results indicated that the deacetylation of KGM had a slight influence on the secondary structure of the proteins. SDS-PAGE results showed that DKGM enhanced the intensity of the main heavy chains of myosin and actin. Examination of the network structure of the surimi gels revealed that DKGM might combine around the filaments of myofibrillar proteins like a rosary through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. As a consequence, the myfibrillar protein aggregation was changed and the microstructures of the surimi became more compact and fibrous. The results indicated that the deacetylation of KGM led to an increase in hydrophobicity, which influenced the hydrophobic interaction of the myofibrillar proteins. As a result, the aggregation of the myofibrillar proteins was promoted and the physico-chemical properties of the surimi gel were improved."

The flow separation zone near the confluence of a river network is a favorite habitat and feeding place for silver carp, which is one of the four major species of Chinese carp and usually provides positive rheotaxis to water flow. In the current study, a series of laboratory experiments were done to determine the behavioral responses of juvenile silver carp to the hydrodynamic forces near the separation zone of a channel confluence. The locomotion and trajectory of juvenile silver carp were recorded by infrared thermal imaging, while the flow velocity field near the separation zone was measured by a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system. A total of 60 juvenile silver carp were released near the separation zone among which 40 carp swam in the upstream direction. Amongst them, 24 carp swam to the tributary and the remaining 16 swam into the main channel. Almost all these 24 carp travelled initially along the boundary of the separation zone near the corner, where flow shear was strongest, and then swam to the tributary. Instead of avoiding zones of strong vorticity, they chose and followed a trajectory along which the flow vorticity was large. On encountering these vortical flows, they increased the tail beat frequency and decreased the tail-beat amplitude to maintain body stability. These observations provide important knowledge on locomotion of fish near river confluences and are beneficial for the fish habitat protection.

Firstly, RACNs were extracted from roselle dehydrated calyxes. Secondly, SPVA aqueous solution was obtained with a mass rate of 2: 1 (starch/PVA). Thirdly, the colorimetric films were fabricated by immobilizing 30, 60 and 120 mg RACNs/100 g starch into SPVA matrix with casting/solvent evaporation method. FTIR spectra of the colorimetric films showed that RACNs were successfully immobilized into the SPVA matrix. X-ray diffraction spectra and SEM micrographs indicated that the crystallinity of PVA was reduced during the film-forming process and the compatibility between starch and PVA was improved, owing to the presence of RACNs. The incorporation of RACNs led to a decrease of water content and tensile strength and an increase of elongation at break of the colorimetric films compared with the SPVA film. The color stability test showed that the colorimetric films were stable at refrigeration temperature and room temperature up to 14 days with relative color changes below than 5%. The colorimetric films with lower content of RACNs were found more sensitive towards ammonia. An application trial was conducted to monitor the freshness of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) at refrigeration temperature. The colorimetric films presented visible color changes over time due to a variety of basic volatile amines known as total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N).

In the present study, we supplemented their taxonomic characteristics by the morphological, histological and molecular methods. Myxobolus kiuchowensis Chen in Chen et Ma, 1998 formed small ellipsoidal plasmodia in the intestinal wall of bighead carp. Its spores appeared asymmetrical obovate in frontal view and fusiform in lateral view. Tiny mamillary protrusion in the anterior of some spores was observed. Two pyriform polar capsules were unequal. Histologically, M. kiuchowensis infected the tunica muscularis of host intestine. Myxobolus abitus Li et Nie, 1973 formed sausage-like plasmodia in the gills of silver carp. Its spores appeared oblate in frontal view and fusiform in lateral view. Two pyriform polar capsules were unequal and an obvious inter-capsule appendix was observed. Histological examination revealed that M. abitus developed in the interlamellar-epithelium of host gills. Myxobolus pavlovskii (Akhmerov, 1954) Landsberg et Lom, 1991 formed sausage-like plasmodia both in the gills of silver carp and bighead carp. Spores of M. pavlovskii were proximate oval in frontal view and fusiform in lateral view. Two pyriform polar capsules were unequal. The BLAST search indicated the SSU rDNA sequences of M. kiuchowensis and M. abitus were not identical to any sequence, however, the SSU rDNA sequences of M. pavlovskii were identical to that of M. paylovskii recorded previously. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the present three species robustly clustered together in Cyprinid group and Asia group."	"10.1016/j.parint.2018.04.011"	"internal-pdf://3814190250/Zhang-2018.pdf"

Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), a species filter-feeding planktivorous fish, feed on particle between 4 and 85 mu m in size, and the respiratory process works together with feeding mechanism when filtering plankton from water. The aim of this study was to assess the physiological response of silver carp exposed to 5 mu m polystyrene microspheres during 48 h of exposure followed by 48 h of depuration through the gill histology, and oxidative stress biomarkers in intestine. The results revealed that microplastics can pass through the whole digestive tract of silver carp and be excreted by feces. Low microplastic concentration (80 mu g/L) induced oxidative stress and up-regulation of TUB84 and HSP70 gene in intestine, and silver carp have ability to recover after the exposure to microplastic was removed. High microplastic concentration (800 mu g/L) definitely cause significant damage to gills and intestines, in this situation, far beyond the possibility of fish own repair, and even when the threaten removed, silver carp can't recovery soon. Our studies assessed the dosage-effect relationship with physiological stress on silver carp when exposure to microplastics."

The fish carrying capacity of a water body is the maximum fish yield that can be carried by the natural bait organisms in the water body under the ideal natural conditions without feeding and fertilization. The evaluation of fish productivity is an important basis for rational stocking, rational fishing, and the scientific utilization of natural bait resources in a water area. This paper adopts the background data of the Shengjin Lake fishery ecosystem and uses the bait-based estimation method. The results show that (1) the annual yield of silver carp fed on phytoplankton is 1.5 million kg; (2) the annual yield of bighead carp fed on zooplankton is 1.295 million kg; (3) the annual yield of benthos is 310,000 kg; (4) the annual yield of organic detritus is 280,000 kg; and (5) as the coverage of water grass in Shengjin Lake is less than 10%, it should be protected and restored rather than used by fish. In general, the annual maximum carrying capacity of fish in Shengjin Lake is 3.385 million kg, except for water and grass."	"10.3390/ijerph19138177"	"internal-pdf://0672327093/jjCXN"

To quantify the potential effects of AC on the food web in Lake Erie, we developed an Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) food web model and simulated four AC diet composition scenarios (high, low, and no detritus and low detritus with Walleye Sander vitreus and Yellow Perch Perca flavescens larvae) and two nutrient load scenarios (the 1999 baseline load and 2X the baseline [HP]). We quantified the uncertainty of the potential AC effects by coupling the EwE model with estimates of parameter uncertainty in AC production, consumption, and predator diets obtained using structured expert judgment. Our model projected mean +/- SD AC equilibrium biomass ranging from 52 +/- 34 to 104 +/- 75 kg/ha under the different scenarios. Relative to baseline simulations without AC, AC invasion under all detrital diet scenarios decreased the biomass of most fish and zooplankton groups. The effects of AC in the HP scenario were similar to those in the detrital diet scenarios except that the biomasses of most Walleye and Yellow Perch groups were greater under HP because these fishes were buffered from competition with AC by increased productivity at lower trophic levels. Asian carp predation on Walleye and Yellow Perch larvae caused biomass declines among all Walleye and Yellow Perch groups. Large food web impacts of AC occurred in only 2% of the simulations, where AC biomass exceeded 200 kg/ha, resulting in biomass declines of zooplankton and planktivorous fish near the levels observed in the Illinois River. Our findings suggest that AC would affect Lake Erie's food web by competing with other planktivorous fishes and by providing additional prey for piscivores. Our methods provide a novel approach for including uncertainty into forecasts of invasive species' impacts on aquatic food webs."

ACH exerted a better effect on osteoporosis than CCH at the identical dose, whereas proline had no significant effect on repairing osteoporosis compared to the model group. Western blotting results demonstrated that CHs mainly increased bone remodeling by stimulating the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1)/Smad signaling pathway and improving the interaction between collagen and alpha 2 beta 1 integrin.

The results suggested that compared with the non-stressful percussion, ice/water and gill cut stunning resulted in accelerated muscle tenderization with intensive myofibril disintegration and sarcolemma-myofibril detachments. Myowater mobility and distribution were altered by stunning stress, in which gill cut facilitated the migration of immobilized water and free water, thus enhancing the centrifugation loss. In addition, stunning stress promoted the activation of endogenous proteases and the release of cathepsin B and L from lysosomes to myofibrils, which showed significant (P < 0.01) correlations with decreased shear force and elevated myofibril fragmentation index of fillets. Therefore, faster accumulation of cathepsins and myofibril disintegration together contributed to the weakening of texture and WHC in stunning-stressed fish fillets."

Silver carp (SC, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (BC, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) are intensively stocked in lakes and reservoirs in China and share similar food resources and trophic positions in water bodies. To better understand the ecological roles of SC and BC in natural freshwater, two mesotrophic reservoirs (Nanwan and Nianyushan) were selected to compare resource utilization and the trophic niche of these two fish species. Data analysis using Bayesian mixing model showed that SC was more like a fine particulate organic matter (fPOM) feeder, while BC consumed more coarse particulate organic matter (cPOM) and displayed a higher trophic position in both reservoirs. In contrast, niche breadths represented by the corrected standard ellipse area (SEA(C)) were essentially the same for SC and BC in Nanwan (SEA(C) = 6.1 for SC and BC), but much larger for silver carp in Nianyushan (SEA(C) for SC: 11.6, SEA(C) for BC: 4.2). The high stocking ratio of SC/BC in Nianyushan was the probable reason for the large SEA(C) of silver carp, which suggested that silver carp could use more food resources and become more competitive with a higher stocking biomass ratio. The results indicated that the trophic partitioning of filter feeders might be regulated by the stocking biomass ratio of the fish to some extent."

In this study, an investigation was conducted for significant fungal infections of 12 species of fish in four regions in Xinjiang, China, to understand the distribution of local fish fungal pathogens. Twenty-six fungal strains with pathogenicity were isolated, and the challenge experiment showed that eight strains from Changji area had high infection rate to fish eggs. Based on internal transcribed spacer sequence data and molecular analysis, the 26 strains were classified into nine different species of six fungal genera. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all strains were divided into two clades, namely Cluster 1 (contains only the genus Mucor) and Cluster 2 (consists of five small branches), and the distribution of strains from the same region was scattered in two clusters. There is no strict host selectivity for these fungi to infect fish. Mucor sp. are the main fungal pathogen of fish in these four regions, whereas Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Carassius auratus are two types of fish that were susceptible to pathogen. In addition, the environmental adaptability experiments showed that eight highly pathogenic strains have different adaptability to the environment, and their optimum temperature and pH were 25 degrees C and 7.0, respectively, whereas the concentration of NaCl was negatively correlated with the growth of strains.

However, the quantity of bighead carp and its effect on water quality and plankton community have been the focus of debate among ecologists. Herein, in order to more accurately simulate the environmental conditions of lakes, we selected earthen ponds with large areas adjacent to Lake Qiandao from May to August in 2016 to study the responses of water quality condition and plankton community to a gradient of bighead carp stocked alone. Experimental groups with different densities of carp stocked were set as follows: 12.1 (LF), 23.5 (MF), and 32.5 g/m(3) (HF), and a control group with no fish (NF). Results showed that total phosphorus (TP) in the fish-containing groups considerably decreased, and the lowest chlorophyll-a concentration (chl-a) was detected in the MF group. The biomass accumulation of the crustacean zooplankton was suppressed after carp was introduced, but the diversity, richness, and evenness of the crustacean zooplankton were weakly affected, except in the HF group. Phytoplankton biomass especially that of cyanobacteria was grazed rapidly by fish in the MF and HF groups and biodiversity indices were considerably increased in the fish-containing groups, especially in the late stages of the experiment. At a fish stocking density of 23.5-38.8 g/m(3), the highest efficiency in controlling cyanobacteria and promoting water condition was achieved, and the impact on zooplankton diversity was weak.

Hypophthalmichthys molitrix"	"A 30‐day experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of C/N ratio on water quality and bacterial community in an integrated system comprising one molluscan species (pearl mussel Hyriopsis cumingii) and two fish species (gibel carp Carassius gibelio and silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) at five C/N ratios (6, 8, 10, 12 and 14). The mussel and fishes were reared in the experimental tanks (400 L), but gibel carp received formulated feed. Water quality in the experimental tanks was analysed on day 0, 10, 20 and 30, and bacterial community in the water column and sediment was analysed on day 30. Total nitrogen, total phosphorus and total organic carbon accumulated in the tanks over time. Ammonia and nitrite decreased with the increase in C/N ratio. Bacterial community in the water column and sediment changed at the phylum and genus levels with the increase in C/N ratio, and the critical C/N ratio causing a functional shift of bacterial community occurred at 10 in water column and 12 in sediment. The increase in C/N ratio benefited the growth of both potential probiotics and pathogenic bacteria. The high C/N ratio enhanced the bacterial functions of chemoheterotrophy and hydrocarbon degradation, but depressed the functions of nitrification and denitrification in the water column and sediment respectively. This study reveals that the C/N ratio can be used as a tool to manipulate the bacterial community and water quality in the mussel‐fish integrated system."

According to the major component of stocked animals, the ponds were grouped into four types: black carp Mylopharyngodon piceus, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, yellow catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco and pearl mussel Hyriopsis cumingii ponds. Each type of pond was stocked with three species of Chinese carps (silver carp, bighead carp and gibel carp) to form a unique mode of fish polyculture or mussel-fish integrated culture. The bacterial composition was identified using 16S rDNA sequencing. Totally, 3701 and 11150 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified from the water and sediment samples respectively. The number of OTUs, abundance-based coverage estimator, Chao1 index and Shannon diversity index were lower in the water column than in the sediment, suggesting that diversity and stability of bacterial community were higher in the sediment. In the water column, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes dominated at the phylum level, and 26 dominant genera were identified. In the sediment, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria and Nitrospirae dominated at the phylum level, and 25 dominant genera were identified. Bacterial compositions between the ponds with different aquaculture modes were similar at the phylum levels, but varied at the genus levels. The bacterial composition in the ponds was correlated with hardness, ammonia and total nitrogen in the water column. This study indicates that the type of aquaculture mode is a factor regulating the microbial community, which provides an insight towards microbial management through probiotic manipulation in pond culture."

However, genomic locations of potential sex-related loci in these two fishes are still unknown. In this study, a high-resolution genetic linkage map was constructed by using 2976 SNP and 924 microsatellite markers in a F1 full-sib family of bighead carp, the length of which spanned 2022.34 cM with an average inter-marker distance of 0.52 cM. Comparative genomics revealed a high level of genomic synteny between bighead carp and zebrafish as well as grass carp. QTL fine mapping for sex trait was performed based on this linkage map of bighead carp and an unpublished linkage map of silver carp. A map distance of 3.863 cM (69.787–73.650 cM) on LG19 of bighead carp and 4.705 cM (79.096–83.801 cM) on LG21 of silver carp was significantly associated with sex phenotypes, and these two LGs are homologous between two fish species. Fourteen markers harboring in these regions were in strong linkage disequilibrium with the sex phenotype variance explained (PVE) varying from 89 to 100%. Two common markers were mapped on the QTL regions of bighead carp and silver carp, suggesting that these two carp species may have similar genetic bases for sex determination. Eleven potentially sex-related genes were identified within or near the sex QTL markers in two species. This study provided insights into elucidating mechanisms and evolution of sex determination in cyprinid fishes."	"10.1007/s10126-019-09929-3"	"internal-pdf://4012699075/m563E"

As a well-known invasive species, a number of factors associated with the ecological adaptations of this species are largely unknown. Here, we present a chromosomal-level assembly of the species based on the PacBio Sequel II platform and Hi-C scaffolding technology. Based on the high-quality genome sequences and previous genome sequencing projects, a number of genes that were probably subject to positive selection reside in the genome of H. molitrix, and the last common ancestors of H. molitrix and H. nobilis were identified. Some of these genes may partially explain the mechanisms of H. molitrix for surviving damage due to toxic algae. Demographic history estimation suggests that the effective population size (EPS) of the species may have constantly increased along with the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, started to decline when quaternary glaciation started, and further declined during the Younger Dryas Period. Moreover, the introgression from H. nobilis to H. molitrix in North America was corroborated based on the whole-genome sequencing data, and the proportion of introgressed regions was estimated to be approximately 5.8%. Based on the high-quality assembly, the possible mechanisms by which H. molitrix adapts to its endemic and invaded locations were profiled."

Biological invasions have been shown to be linked to the genetic properties of alien host species. It is thus plausible that the holobiont, the host, and its associated microbiome act as an entity to drive invasion success. The bighead carp and silver carp (bigheaded carps), invasive species that exhibit extensive hybridization in the Mississippi River Basin (MRB), provided a unique model to test the holobiont hypothesis of invasion. Here, we investigated the microbiomes of foreguts and hindguts in bigheaded carps and their reciprocal hybrids reared in aquaculture ponds using 16S amplicons and the associated gene prediction. We found an admixed pattern in the gut microbiome community in bigheaded carp hybrids. The hybrid gut microbiomes showed special characteristics such as relatively high alpha diversity in the foregut, an increasing dissimilarity between foreguts and hindguts, and a remarkable proportion of genes coding for putative enzymes related to their digestion of main food resources (Cyanobacteria, cellulose, and chitin). The pond-reared hybrids had advantageous features in genes coding for putative enzymes related to their diet. The above results collectively suggested that the gut microbiomes of hybrids could be beneficial to their local adaptation (e.g., food resource utilization), which might have facilitated their invasion in the MRB. The gut microbial findings, along with the intrinsic genomic features likely associated with life-history traits revealed in our recent study, provide preliminary evidence supporting the holobiont hypothesis of invasion."

Ichthyoplankton monitoring along the Illinois Waterway (IWW) has provided information on abundances of Asian carp eggs in the IWW's navigation pools. Post-fertilization times derived from egg development stages and water temperatures can be used to estimate spawning times of Asian carp eggs, but estimating how far these eggs have drifted requires information on river hydraulics. A Fluvial Egg Drift Simulator (FluEgg) program was designed to predict the drift of Asian carp eggs in the riverine environment with egg growth considered. This paper presents a reverse-time particle tracking (RTPT) algorithm for back-casting the spawning location of eggs from their collection site. The RTPT algorithm was implemented as a module in FluEgg. The new version of FluEgg was coupled with an unsteady hydrodynamic model of the IWW to predict the spawning locations for 530 eggs that were collected in June 2015. The results indicate that tailwater sections below the Locks and Dams (L&Ds) in each navigation pool appear to be preferred spawning locations for Silver Carp (a species of Asian carp). From the data analyzed, the most upstream spawning location for the June 2015 spawning period was in the upper Marseilles navigation pool, downstream of the Dresden Island L&D. The RTPT algorithm can efficiently estimate spawning locations for multiple egg samples."	"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.06.003"	"internal-pdf://3592454649/Zhu-2018.pdf"

In a dark featureless square enclosure, groups of 3 fish were tracked and the distance of each fish from speakers and their swimming trajectories relative to sound pressure and particle acceleration were analyzed before, and then while an outboard motor sound was played. All three species exhibited negative phonotaxis during the first two exposures after which they ceased responding.

Notably, when close to the active speaker fish swam away from the source and maintained a nearly perfect 0 degrees orientation to the axes of particle acceleration. Fish did not enter sound fields greater than 140 dB (ref. 1 mu Pa). These results demonstrate that carp avoid complex sounds in darkness and while initial responses may be informed by sound pressure, sustained oriented avoidance behavior is likely mediated by particle motion.

Swimming performance, the relationship between swim speed and time-to-fatigue, has been used to design fishways and identify barriers to fish movement. However, existing numerical models do not all capture the variability in swimming abilities nor the turbulent, unsteady, and three-dimensional aspect of natural flows. This deficiency is particularly problematic for fish species whose behavior is poorly understood (i.e., invasive fish) and at sites with complex flow patterns. Here, we combine species-specific swimming performance with high resolution abstractions of fluid flow in a new agent-based framework to model fatigue of upstream swimming fish under turbulent flow conditions. Our model simulates fish paths, in the absence of information on their behavioral tendencies, based on a rules-set aimed at fish swimming as far upstream as possible before complete exhaustion by selecting the path of least fatigue. We demonstrate how this model functions by examining theoretical passage of invasive silver carp, Hypopthalmichthys molitrix, and bighead carp, H. nobilis, as well a native fish, the lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, through a typical Mississippi River lock-and-dam (Lock-and-Dam #8 near Genoa, WI). The model then tests whether passage could be reduced by altering spillway gate operations. Model results suggest that passage of all three species is low under current gate operations and that passage of both carp species could be further reduced by about half through minor changes in spillway gate operation without apparent impacts on navigation, scour, or lake sturgeon passage. Model results are qualitatively consistent with observed passage rates monitored by other studies at similar lock-and-dams and are consistent with the possibility that the model likely overestimates passage rates by relying on physiological data only. This approach could be exported to other applications and fish species to help manage and control fish migration and dispersal, especially for fish whose behavior and ecology are poorly understood and not presently quantifiable."

The results of this study were compared with global standards. As well as in this multispecies monitoring, health risk assessment of consumers by EPA/WHO instructions has been done. The concentrations of mercury were below the limits for fish proposed by United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Health Organization (WHO), US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and European Union (EU). Lead concentrations in Ctenopharyngodon idella, Cyprinus carpio, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix was under the scope proposed by FAO, WHO, FDA, Turkish Acceptable Limits (TAL), United Kingdom Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food (UK MAFF) and National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRS), but lead concentration in Schizocypris altidorsalis, and Schizothorax zardunyi were higher than WHO and TAL. Health risk assessment of consumers from the intake of metal contaminated (mercury and lead) was evaluated by using Hazard Quotient (HQ) calculations. The human health hazard Quotient (index) showed that the cumulative risk greatly increases with increasing fish consumption rate, thus yielding an alarming concern for the consumer’s health. •The results of the present study aimed to provide data from Caspian Sea, Anzali wetland, and Hamoon wetland as indicators of natural and anthropogenic impacts on aquatic ecosystem as well as to evaluate the human hazard index associated with fish consumption.•The results show that for mercury, the Maximum Allowable Fish Consumption Rate (Meals/Month) is related to Hemiculter Leucisculus.•The results for lead concentration indicate that there is no HQ value?>?1, indicating that humans would not experience any significant health risk if they only consume metals from these species of fish from the hamun wetland."

The results showed that the solubility of each fraction of SCSP was higher than 90%, SCSP-II and III were higher than 95%. The antioxidant powers on ? OH, O-2(-) ? and Fe3+ were ranked as SCSP-III > SCSP-II > SCSP-I > SCSP. All fractions of SCSP had no toxic or side effects in mouse B16 melanoma cells experiments in vitro. At a concentration of 0.01 mg/mL, the tyrosinase activity of B16 cells in the SCSP-II fraction was significantly lower than that of the alpha-arbutin (P < 0.05), at 65.37%. The molecular weight distribution of SCSP was 399-1404 Dalton and 13 peptide sequences were detected. Among them, SCSP-II contained many hydrophobic amino acids, and SCSP-III stood out for combining arginine with hydrophobic amino acids. This may be the reason why the low molecular-weight SCSPs show the strong antioxidant activity and strong tyrosinase inhibition. The work provides a data base for the development of SCSP and increases the possibility of its application."
