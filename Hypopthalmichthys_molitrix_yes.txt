Alternatively, ad hoc inferences from sparse occurrence records leave biologists to face conservation decisions with high uncertainty. Simple predictive models can fill the gap between these two alternatives. One method to predict the probable range of riverine fishes is to add the average distance between occurrences to the most distal occurrence (parametric estimator). However, there are drawbacks to this method when the distances between occurrences deviate from a non‐uniform distribution. Herein, estimators that are robust to non‐uniformity, a non‐parametric and an optimal linear estimator, were adapted and compared to the parametric estimator using simulations. The non‐parametric estimator showed the least bias and variance in bias for the probable range endpoint. The optimal linear estimator best balanced type I and type II errors in the maximum probable range estimate (i.e., upper CI). Application of the robust estimators were made to demonstrate how sampling can be planned based on available effort (Gulf Coast walleye, Sander vitreus) and where early detection sampling may be focused (silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). This study provides biologists with a suite of simple options (R code provided as supplementary material) to bridge the gap between ad hoc inference and complex modeling over a range of scenarios. Future studies should focus on accounting for false‐positives, variable effort, and develop online apps for accessibility."	"10.1002/rra.3969"	"internal-pdf://1253175004/Aldridge-2022.pdf"

Hence, in this study, a deep learning neural network as a smart, real-time and non-destructive method was developed and applied to automate the identification of four economically important carp species namely common carp (Cyprinus carpio), grass carp (Ctenopharingodon idella), bighead carp (Hypophtalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). The obtained results proved that our approach, evaluated through 5-fold cross-validation, achieved the highest possible accuracy of 100 %. The achieved high level of classification accuracy was due to the ability of the suggested deep model to build a hierarchy of self-learned features, which was in accordance with the hierarchy of these fish's identification keys.

To explore the influence of environmental factors on eDNA particle size distribution (PSD), we manipulated fish communities across nine experimental ponds, which led to differences in a suite of environmental covariates (biochemical oxygen demand, chlorophyll a concentration, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, and turbidity) over 5 months. At the end of the experiment, we serially filtered water samples from each pond through 5 filter sizes (20, 10, 5, 1, and 0.2 µm) followed by eDNA precipitation. We used quantitative PCR to determine the proportion of Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) or bigheaded carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and H. nobilis) eDNA captured within each size fraction. Based on eDNA concentrations recorded at each size fraction, we parameterized a Weibull distribution to describe the eDNA PSD of each species in each pond. Likelihood ratio tests suggested that PSD did not differ between species but did differ across ponds. Stepwise multiple regressions indicated that the specific environmental factors with the greatest influence on PSD differed depending on the pore size of the filter used for capture. Notably, positive associations with chlorophyll and turbidity were most important for predicting capture with a 10‐µm filter, suggesting that eDNA is sticky, and the presence of relatively large particles such as algal cells or other suspended sediments can dramatically alter eDNA PSD. Therefore, we advocate that researchers and managers consider analysis of eDNA PSD within their study systems to optimize eDNA capture efficiencies and increase detection probabilities across variable biotic and abiotic conditions. Furthermore, reporting eDNA PSD evaluations across more diverse systems has the potential to reveal broader patterns of eDNA capture efficiency and improve research and natural resource management with eDNA applications."

Research and development of new invasive species barriers is often evaluated in pond and field scales using high-resolution telemetry data. Telemetry data sets can be a rich source of data about fish movement and behavior but can be difficult to analyze due to the size of these data sets as well as their irregular sampling intervals. Due to the challenges, most barrier studies only use summary endpoints, such as barrier passage counts or average (e.g., mean or median) fish distance from the barrier, to describe the data. To examine more fine-scale fish movement patterns, we developed a first-order Markov chain. We then used this model to help understand the impacts of a barrier on fish behavior. For our study system, we used data from a previous study examining how bighead and silver carp (two invasive fish species in the United States) responded to a carbon dioxide (CO2) barrier in a pond. Considerations for management Based upon our findings, management considerations include: Markov chains can be used to describe and quantify movement patterns of aquatic organisms responding to barriers. These models provide insight not possible with previously used summary approaches. The CO(2)barrier changed both the locations of fish and movement patterns of fish. The changes in movement were not captured using conventional endpoints. Specifically, fish had less random movement patterns during periods of CO(2)exposure. This provides evidence that bighead and silver carp actively avoided areas with CO(2)and also shows that our approach can help assess random versus nonrandom movements"	"10.1111/nrm.12281"	"internal-pdf://1045201370/Borland-2020.pdf"

Differences in CPUE between electrofishing methods were detected for 2 of 41 species collected across 2 years of sampling at 20 sites along the Illinois River. The mean catch rate of Silver Carp using the experimental technique was 2.2 times the mean catch rate of the LTRM electrofishing technique; the increased capture efficiency at low relative abundance emphasizes the utility of this method for early detection. The experimental electrofishing also collected slightly larger Silver Carp (mean: 510.7 mm TL versus 495.2 mm TL), and nearly four times as many Silver Carp independently jumped into the boat during experimental transects.

In the forty years before 2009, cyanobacteria frequently bloomed in WY Lake, an event which has not occurred since 2009. The stocking density of filter-feeding carp was estimated to be more than 50 g/m3 in July after 2009, approximately double the amount observed before 2009, and the ratio of silver carp to bighead carp (SBR) increased from 0.8 to more than 1.6. Compared with the water quality between 2004 and 2007, the total nitrogen (TN) and the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration decreased while total phosphorus (TP) and transparency (SD) increased significantly after 2009 (P < 0.05). The decreasing Chl-a concentration was observed in Jul, Jun, May, Jul, and Mar in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2016, and 2017, respectively. The Chl-a concentration was significantly negatively correlated with TP (P < 0.05), and no significant correlation with TN was observed (P > 0.05). A significant negative correlation was observed between fish yield and SD (P < 0.05). The results also showed that filter-feeding carp more effectively restrained algae growth when SD was low. These results indicated that a high density of filter-feeding fish with increased SBR interfered with the driving effects of nutrients and temperature on the growth of algal biomass and then restrained bloom of algae. It may be necessary to take SD into consideration for determining the appropriate fish stocking density for the biomanipulation of algae."

While refuting the long-standing notion that riverine zooplankton communities are numerically depauperate and spatially homogeneous, this also shows that the importance of abiotic and biotic drivers and the consistency of ecological patterns are still poorly understood for these communities. We collected zooplankton along 300 km of the Illinois River for 5 years to test the influence of a suite of biotic and abiotic variables on zooplankton density, biomass, and diversity. We hypothesized abiotic variables such as temperature, turbidity, and velocity would be predominant predictors, with biotic variables like planktivory becoming important when physical factors do not constrain them. Results showed basin-wide declines in zooplankton taxonomic richness as planktivory from the invading silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) increased. In contrast, density and biomass were explained by abiotic factors at the basin scale, with velocity, turbidity, and pH driving biomass and velocity driving density. We also found that both the driving factors and the plankton responses varied among the upper, middle, and lower sections of the Illinois River. We conclude that while zooplankton communities of the Illinois River are highly structured in space, the driving forces behind their distribution patterns are not simple. Instead, there is a complex spatio-temporal template of biological, chemical, and hydraulic factors shaping these communities in the Illinois River. Along with emphasizing the importance of spatial heterogeneity in large river ecosystems, these results also support a growing view that invasive species interactions can supersede the well-established role of abiotic factors in explaining global freshwater diversity losses. This also highlights the importance of including long-term zooplankton sampling in ecological monitoring programs in diverse and productive large river systems like the Illinois."

We analyzed fish abundance (catch per unit effort from electrofishing) and water-quality data collected from 1994 to 2013 from three reaches where silver carp populations have been established since 2000, and three reaches where they are not established. Our results provide empirical evidence of a negative effect of invasive silver carp on native sport fish in the UMRS. Although water temperature, suspended solid concentration, and flooding also differed substantially between control and invaded reaches, only silver carp abundance had a direct negative relationship with the abundance of adult sport fish. Our analyses suggest that the mechanism for this decline may be competition for zooplankton between silver carp and larval/juvenile sport fish.

This ability drives their efficient consumption of phytoplankton and because they feed low on the food chain they have an important place in aquaculture worldwide. In North America, where they are considered invasive, silver carp deplete food resources for native species and in so doing occupy increased niche space. Here, we determine the ontogenetic stage and size at which silver carp are morphologically capable of primarily feeding on particles <10 mu m. Ecological studies on this species have shown that there is an ontogenetic shift in diet as predominantly zooplanktivorous juveniles later switch to eating much smaller phytoplankton. The occupation of this new trophic niche presents both a metabolic and a mechanical challenge to these fish, since it is unclear how they can efficiently feed on such small particles. We hypothesize that the epibranchial organ (EBO) in silver carp is essential in aggregating these small particles of food, allowing the species to consume mass quantities of tiny particles, thus mitigating metabolic constraints. In this study, we investigate early ontogeny of the EBO in silver carp to determine when this structure achieves the requisite morphology to become functional. We find that at around 80 mm standard length (SL) the EBOs are consistently filled with food, demonstrating that this accumulating organ has become functional. This size corresponds with previous ecological data documenting important shifts in the type of food consumed. While the basic bauplan of the EBO is established very early in ontogeny (by 15 mm SL), multiple waves of histological maturation of muscle, cartilage, gill rakers and epithelium ultimately form the functional structure."

Its complex trophic anatomy may help explain the apparent efficiency with which they consume phytoplankton, outcompeting native filter feeders. This cypriniform species is characterized by trophic synapomorphies that include a palatal organ, loss of upper pharyngeal jaws, and a hypertrophied lower pharyngeal jaw. However, in silver carp these structures have become greatly modified and diverge from the more basal condition that characterizes species such as goldfish. The trophic apparatus of silver carp is composed of discrete structures that are functionally coupled: filtering plates, paired epibranchial organs (EBO), a modified palatal organ composed of large muscular folds that interdigitate with the filtering plates, and hypertrophied lower pharyngeal jaws and teeth. The filtering plates fill a significant portion of the buccal cavity, especially since the distal parts of these filtering plates make up a key component of the EBOs. EBOs, food aggregating structures found in many teleosts, are thought to have independently evolved at least six times. Ranging in complexity from small slits on the dorsal wall of the pharyngeal cavity to exceedingly intricate spiraling structures, EBOs are morphologically diverse among filter-feeding fishes. Despite this morphological diversity and broad taxonomic distribution, little is known regarding the functional anatomy of the EBO. Moreover, the EBO in silver carp is distinct from the organs previously described in other species, being created by four independent pharyngeal involutions (instead of the more typical one or two) that form spiral-shaped pharyngeal tubes surrounded by circumferential muscle. On each side of the head greatly hypertrophied hyomandibulae and opercles are connected to the anterior cartilaginous caps of the bilateral EBOs via enlarged muscles. Given that these fish are pump filter feeders we hypothesize that the opercula may compress and expand the EBOs during pumping causing food to be moved posteriorly toward the pharyngeal jaws."

Filter feeding teleosts typically employ elongated and tightly packed gill rakers with secondary bony or epithelial modifications that increase filtering efficiency. The gill rakers of Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, silver carp, are anatomically distinct from and more complex than the filtering apparatus of other teleostean fishes. The silver carp filtering apparatus is composed of biserial, fused filtering plates used to capture particles ranging in size from 4 to 80 m. Early in ontogeny, at 15-25 mm standard length (SL), silver carp gill rakers are reminiscent of other more stereotypical teleostean rakers, characterized by individual lanceolate rakers that are tightly packed along the entirety of the branchial arches. At 30 mm SL, secondary epithelial projections and concomitant dermal ossification begin to stitch together individual gill rakers. During later juvenile stages, dermal bone further modifies the individual gill rakers and creates a bony scaffold that supports the now fully fused and porous epithelium. By adulthood, the stitching of bone and complete fusion of the overlying epithelium creates rigid filtering plates with morphologically distinct faces. The inner face of the plates is organized into a net-like matrix while the outer face has a sponge-like appearance comprised of differently sized pores. Here, we present morphological data from an ontogenetic series of the filtering apparatus within silver carp. These data inform hypotheses regarding both how these gill raker plates may have evolved from a more basal condition, as well as how this novel architecture allows this species to feed on exceedingly small phytoplankton, particles that represent a greater filtering challenge to the typical anatomy of the gill rakers of fishes."

Silver carp utilize modified gill rakers to capture a specific range of food; however, their greatly modified filtering morphology allows them to feed on phytoplankton and zooplankton ranging in size from 4 to 85 µm. The filtering apparatus of silver carp comprises rigid filtering plates where the outer anatomy of these plates is characterized by long parallel channels that change in orientation along the length of the plate. Here, we investigate the underlying morphology and concomitant hydrodynamics that support the filtration mechanisms of silver and bighead carp. Bighead carp are also invasive filter feeders, but their filtering apparatus is morphologically distinct from that of silver carp. Using 3D particle image velocimetry, we determined how particles and fluid interact with the surface of the gill rakers/plates. Filtering plates in silver carp induce strong directed vortical flow, whereas the filtering apparatus of bighead carp resulted in a type of haphazard cross-flow filtration. The organized vortical flow established by silver carp likely increased the number of interactions that the particle-filled water had with the filtering membrane. This strong vortical organization is maintained only at 0.75 body lengths s<sup>-1</sup>, and vortical flow is poorly developed and maintained at slower and faster speeds. Moreover, we found that absolute vorticity magnitude in silver carp is an order of magnitude greater than in bighead carp."	"10.1242/jeb.183350"	"internal-pdf://0336101194/Cohen-2018.pdf"

Invasive Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) have spread throughout much of the Mississippi River Basin, and their presence has resulted in multiple negative ecosystem effects. Silver Carp are known to move hundreds of km, which has likely contributed to their rapid spread. Our study examined movement patterns and environmental cues for movement in Silver Carp based on acoustic telemetry of tagged fish that ranged widely (i.e., mobile) and those that did not range far from the site of their original capture and tagging (i.e., sedentary) in the Wabash River, USA. Sedentary and mobile designations were made based on observed extremes of mean annual ranges, and these designations were consistent within seasons and among years. Both movement groups displayed seasonal variation in movements, with mobile Silver Carp consistently moving greater distances within each season and sedentary Silver Carp exhibiting lower variability in distances moved than mobile individuals. Discharge (change in discharge) and temperature were significant predictors of mobile and sedentary individuals' movements. Additional environmental variables (i.e., cumulative growing degree day, day of year, and change in temperature) also related to movement likelihood of sedentary individuals, whereas total length was the only additional variable that influenced movement likelihood of mobile individuals. Total length was significantly related to movement distance for both groups of Silver Carp, but the relationship was negative for sedentary fish and positive for mobile fish. Results point to differences in behavior that may require targeted management strategies to achieve agency goals to interrupt mobile individual movements that can result in range expansion. Such strategies may also limit introductions and invasions by other aquatic invasive species that exhibit similar behaviors."	"10.1007/s10530-022-02795-6"	"internal-pdf://0624263048/Coulter-2022.pdf"

Diet overlap between invasive Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and native planktivores has been linked to declines in condition and abundance of native planktivores. However, there is little information on how such diet overlap varies temporally. We used stable-isotope ratios to examine seasonal resource overlap among Silver Carp and two native planktivores, Gizzard Shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) and Bigmouth Buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus). Resource overlap between Bigmouth Buffalo and Silver Carp was minimal (<1%) in all seasons, whereas overlap between Gizzard Shad and Silver Carp (7-36%) was larger and varied seasonally. The greatest resource overlap among species occurred in summer, while the smallest overlap occurred in spring. Resource use by Silver Carp appears to be highly specialized in the fall, as indicated by a narrow isotopic niche.Variation in niche size among seasons suggests that Silver Carp may be plastic in their resource use. Overall, the limited resource overlap among invasive and native species revealed in this study suggests potentially low invasive-native competition, although competition may have acted prior to our study to produce shifts in resource use by native fishes."

We quantified fish density throughout the 460 km long Illinois River using hydroacoustic surveys at 23 sites while concurrently collecting 192 surface water samples for eDNA analysis. We found that Silver Carp numerical density and biomass density were positively and non-linearly related to eDNA concentration and detection rate. Both eDNA concentration (copy number) and detection rate increased rapidly as Silver Carp density increased but plateaued at moderate densities.

Invasive species pose a dominant threat to biodiversity and biosecurity, particularly in biodiversity hotspots like Kruger National Park, South Africa. The invasive silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, was introduced into the Olifants River and may experience range spread owing to favorable environmental conditions. Intensive monitoring protocols are necessary to effectively manage invasions of species like silver carp. Unfortunately, tropical and sub-tropical aquatic systems are difficult to monitor using conventional methods (e.g., netting, electrofishing and snorkeling) owing to a range of factors including the presence of dangerous megafauna. Conservation of such systems may be advanced by the adoption of novel methods, including environmental DNA (eDNA) detection. Here, we explore the utility of environmental DNA (eDNA) to conduct safe, reliable and repeatable surveys in dangerous watersheds using silver carp as a case study. We conducted eDNA surveys at 12 sites in two neighbouring watersheds, and determined that the species has expanded its range within the Olifants River and to the south in the Sabie River. Expansion in the former is consistent with the presence of suitable spawning conditions. We discuss the implications of this survey for biodiversity monitoring in similar aquatic systems in the tropics and advocate an integrative approach to biomonitoring in these ecosystems."

Hypophthalmichthys molitrix"	"Invasive species can produce complex and unpredictable effects across multiple trophic levels through a combination of direct and indirect pathways. Invasive silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) exert substantial pressure on the link between primary production and intermediate trophic levels in large rivers of the Midwestern USA. The goal of our manuscript was to describe the silver carp population invasion in the Illinois River (Illinois, USA) and explore the potential effects of silver carp on the native biota.We obtained 22 years of data from three long‐term monitoring programmes for phytoplankton, zooplankton, and age‐0 and adult native fishes. To determine when silver carp started affecting native biota, we used nonlinear regression to estimate the change point in silver carp biomass. We then used piecewise linear regression to separately model the response of phytoplankton and age‐0 and adult native fishes, using the model‐estimated change point in silver carp biomass. We tested for differences in taxon‐specific zooplankton density and biomass between pre‐ and post‐establishment periods using generalised linear models. To explore associations between native biota, silver carp and other potential drivers, we used single‐factor linear‐regression models in an information theoretic‐based approach.Our analysis showed individual silver carp condition decreased while their population numbers and biomass increased during their establishment in the Illinois River. Concurrently, analysis of 22 years of producer and consumer abundance and biomass data shows phytoplankton density and macrozooplankton density and biomass decreased—zooplankton by over 90%—during the same period, though the responses of age‐0 native fish biomass and adult native fish biomass were more nuanced.Our study provides compelling evidence of multiple trophic‐level effects from the silver carp invasion in North America and highlights the importance of long‐term data collection and monitoring. Our research shows managers that zooplankton and perhaps phytoplankton are quickly and negatively affected by silver carp, which may eventually cascade into higher trophic levels over longer timescales."

Fish suffer death from gas bubble disease (GBD) caused by TDG supersaturation. Nonetheless, current studies mainly attach importance to the survival of benthic fish affected by TDG supersaturation in the Yangtze River in China. Few studies have attempted to investigate the survival of pelagic fish influenced by TDG supersaturated water and compare the tolerance characteristics to TDG supersaturation between benthic and pelagic fish. To identify the survival of fish species that inhabit the various water layers affected by TDG supersaturation, silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) (pelagic fish) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) (benthic fish) were chosen to conduct an acute exposure experiment of four different TDG supersaturation levels (125%, 130%, 135% and 140%). The findings illustrated that the two fish species both exhibited evident aberrant behaviours of maladjustment in TDG supersaturated water. Obvious GBD symptoms were also found in the test fish. The survival probability of silver carp and common carp decreased with increasing levels of TDG supersaturation. The median survival time (ST50) values of the silver carp exposed to four levels of TDG supersaturated water (125%, 130%, 135% and 140%) were 26.84, 7.96, 5.56 and 3.62 h, respectively, whereas the ST50 values of common carp were 53.50, 26.00, 16.50 and 11.70 h, respectively. When compared with common carp, silver carp had a weaker tolerance to TDG-supersaturated water and were vulnerable to GBD. It shows that levels above 125% are not safe for common carp survival. In terms of the tolerance threshold value, silver carp merits further investigation because it showed lower tolerance to TDG than did common carp."

The panels were verified using population genetic analyses, and species and simulated hybrid discriminations based on the genotype data of all individuals from two populations for each species. The number of alleles (Na), the observed and expected heterozygosity (Ho and He), and the polymorphic information content (PIC) of twelve loci were ranged from 5 to 20, 0.189 to 0.956, 0.177 to 901, and 0.169 to 0.887, respectively. Overall, almost all the microsatellite loci were detected as highly polymorphic across the two species. The populations of same species showed close genetic distances and similar genetic structures. Significant genetic differentiations were only detected between populations from different species, with a higher variation between species (21.17%) compared with that between populations within species (0.18%). In the species and simulated hybrid discrimination analyses, the individuals from different species were separated distinctly, and the simulated hybrids could almost be separated with the true individuals.

The abundance of C. schistorchis exhibited a positive correlation with the host age and condition factor of silver carp, but it showed no relationship with water temperature, pH or DO. The condition factor value of infected fish was significantly higher than that of uninfected fish. These results indicated that food intake, not environmental factors, directly determined infection by the parasite in the host, indicating that an increased food intake would increase the risk of infection. Thus, the number of parasites could be used as an indirect biological marker for assessing the effectiveness of silver carp in filter-feeding on plankton.

However, the use of filter-feeding aquatic animals to control eutrophic water bodies remains debatable. As such, more work is needed to understand the combined effects of submerged macrophytes and aquatic animals on the restoration of eutrophic water bodies. In this study, we first conducted a mesocosm experiment to evaluate the combined effects of submerged macrophytes and aquatic animals on water body restoration, and then applied these results in the field. We found that silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) deteriorated water quality by increasing nutrient and total suspended solid concentrations, and decreased the biomass of submerged macrophytes. However, triangle sail mussels (Hyriopsis cumingii) promoted the establishment of a clear-water state by grazing on phytoplankton and detritus, and stimulating submerged macrophyte growth. In practical ecological engineering, we suggest that silver carp can be used at low density (20 g/m(3)) as a biomanipulation tool, despite their potential to deteriorate water quality. Furthermore, stocking mussels in nets at a biomass of 150 g/m3 can be effectively used to restore eutrophicated water bodies. Finally, Hydrilla verticillata and Potamogeton malaianus, in combination with filter-feeding aquatic animals, are suitable submerged macrophyte species for the restoration of eutrophicated lakes.

This proof-of-concept study addressed these challenges by testing whether food or pheromones might be used to attract invasive carp so they can be measured more readily using eDNA. In two experiments, PIT-tagged carp were stocked into ponds (N = 3 for silver carp; N = 1 for common carp) while one of two stimuli (planktonic food [spirulina] for silver carp and a sex pheromone [prostaglandin F2α] for male common carp) was added to determine if we could attract fish to one side while measuring both fish presence (detections) and eDNA concentrations. The addition of spirulina increased detections of silver carp by 2–3 fold, while eDNA concentrations increased by 4-fold on the test side when compared to the side without the stimulus. The addition of the sex pheromone increased detections of common carp by ~25-fold, where a 6-fold increase in eDNA concentrations was measured (p < 0.05). A strong positive correlation was noted between fish presence and eDNA concentration for both species. These experiments demonstrate that food and pheromone stimuli could be used to attract invasive carp so they could be measured more easily and accurately."

Our study tested factors linked to fine-scale spatial distributions of the most prevalent bigheaded carp species-silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix)-in the upper Illinois River to increase effectiveness of removal efforts.

Piscivorous birds can also contribute the DNA of prey species to a water body. Here, we develop and apply a loading model to estimate the number of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) DNA target marker copies that are potentially deposited by nesting double crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) in the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS). The model assumes a conservative breeding population estimate ranging between 6000 and 8000 cormorants distributed among three large colonies in the Chicago metropolitan area. The model also assumes that cormorants are distributing feces randomly throughout the CAWS in proportion to the amount of time spent at each location. Results show that cormorants may be contributing 2.6 to 113 target marker copies/m(2)/day if birds are spending 22% of their time on open water and 6.4 to 291 target marker copies/m2/day if birds are spending 56% of their time on open water. Over the entire CAWS, cormorants may contribute tens of millions to billions of silver carp DNA copies each day. These target marker loads may be contributing to positive detections of silver carp environmental DNA (eDNA) in the CAWS. This study does not address other potential sources of silver carp genetic material in the CAWS, including live fish, and provides no indication as to whether or not the loads attributed to cormorants are large or small in relation to these other potential sources.

Clinical signs observed in moribund animals included erratic swimming behavior, such as spiraling and spinning at the surface. A moribund specimen was captured by dip net near the surface at Lake Providence Landing in East Carroll Parish, northern Louisiana, and was submitted for analysis. An aseptic necropsy was performed, and diagnostic procedures, including bacteriology, parasitology, histopathology, virology, and electron microscopy, revealed that a gram-positive coccus was the primary pathogen. Pure cultures of the organism were obtained from the brain, and it was the predominant colony type isolated from the spleen, kidney, and liver. Bacterial sepsis caused by the gram-positive coccus and involving multiple organ systems was diagnosed histologically. Bacterial colonization and necrotic lesions were seen in the spleen, liver, kidney, heart, eye, and brain. Numerous cocci were observed dividing intracellularly in phagocytic cells of the kidney and brain by transmission electron microscopy. The organism was identified as Streptococcus dysgalactiae ssp. dysgalactiae by conventional biochemical methods and subsequently by the API 20 Strep system. The identity of the pathogen was later confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Multilocus sequence analysis clustered this isolate along with two other S. dysgalactiae isolates from fish in a divergent phyletic group that was separate from other S. dysgalactiae ssp. dysgalactiae isolates from terrestrial animals, implying a possible novel clade that is pathogenic for fish."

Fertile diploid Grass Carp are used legally for vegetation control in Missouri; however, it is uncertain whether Grass Carp in Truman Reservoir are the result of natural reproduction or escapees. We used ichthyoplankton tows and environmental DNA (eDNA) to investigate which carp species were present in the reservoir basin and if these carps were spawning in reservoir tributaries. Grass Carp eggs were collected in four of five tributaries during June 2014; Neither eggs, larvae, or eDNA of Bighead Carp or Silver Carp were detected. The occurrence of Grass Carp eggs generally coincided with rapid increases in discharge and turbidity. These tributaries may be the smallest rivers worldwide in which spawning of Grass Carp has been documented.

With the imminent threat of their movement into the Great Lakes, the goal of the present study was to assess whether differences in the physiological status between silver carp at the leading edge of their invasion front and core population sites could explain their lack of expansion upstream toward Lake Michigan over the past decade. A transcriptomic approach using RNA sequencing and analysis of plasma variables were used to quantify differences among fish at the leading edge and two downstream core population sites. Leading-edge fish exhibited upregulation of genes associated with xenobiotic defense (e.g., ATP-binding cassette C1 [abcc1], abcc2, abcc6), decreased cell integrity (i.e., macroautophagy and apoptosis; autophagy-related protein 9A [atg9a], caspase 3b [casp3b]), and cholesterol metabolism (e.g., abca1, apolipoprotein A1 [apoa1], sterol O-acyltransferase [soat1]) and downregulation of genes associated with DNA repair (e.g., tumor suppressor p53-binding protein 1 [tp53bp1]) compared to core population sites. Transcriptomic profiles of leading-edge fish were consistent with fish inhabiting a polluted environment and suggest that poorer water quality conditions upstream of the leading edge may represent a non-permanent barrier to silver carp range expansion. The present study provides potential molecular targets for monitoring the physiological status of silver carp over time and in response to future improvements in water quality upstream of their leading edge."

The gill is the first tissue attacked by hypoxia; however, the response of the gills of H. molitrix to hypoxia stress at the tissue, cellular, and molecular levels has not been clearly established. The influence of hypoxia on histological features along with gene expression in silver carp gills were explored in this research. The hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections and electron microscopy examinations of gills indicated that the gill lamellae were seriously twisted, gill filaments were dehisced, and the swelling and shedding of epithelial cell layer in the gill tissue were intensified along with the degree of hypoxia. In the hypoxia, semi-asphyxia, and asphyxia groups, the gill transcriptomic assessment of shifts in key genes, as well as modulatory networks in response to hypoxic conditions revealed 587, 725, and 748 differentially expressed genes, respectively. These genes are abundant in immune response signaling cascades (e.g., complement and coagulation cascades, Nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor signaling cascade, and differentiation of Th1 along with Th2 cells) and oxygen transport [e.g., MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling cascades]. Genes linked to immune response (e.g., c2, c3, c6, klf4, cxcr4, cd45, and cd40) and oxygen transport (e.g., egln1, egln3, epo, ldh, and vegfa) were additionally identified. According to our findings, the silver carp may be using "HIF-1" to obtain additional oxygen during hypoxia. These findings illustrate that hypoxia stress might damage gill tissue, trigger an immunological response, and activate HIF-1 signaling to increase oxygen availability under hypoxic situations. The findings of this work will help scientists better understand the molecular mechanisms driving hypoxia responses in hypoxia-sensitive fish and speed up the development of hypoxia-resistant varieties."

Analysis of more than 590,000 quality-filtered sequences obtained from the foregut, midgut and hindgut of these four carp species revealed high microbial diversity among the samples. The foregut samples of grass carp exhibited more than 1,600 operational taxonomy units (OTUs) and the highest alpha-diversity index, followed by the silver carp foregut and midgut.

Pairwise (weighted) UniFrac distance-based permutational multivariate analysis of variance with fish species as a factor produced significant association (P < 0.01). The gut microbiotas of all four carp species harbored saccharolytic or proteolytic microbes, likely in response to the differences in their feeding habits. In addition, extensive variations were also observed even within the same fish species. Our results indicate that the gut microbiotas of Asian carp depend on the exact species, even when the different species were cohabiting in the same environment.

In this study, the full-length cDNAs of three PHD genes were obtained from Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, which is an important freshwater fish and sensitive to low oxygen tension. The amino acid sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis of PHDs were performed among various species. Furthermore, the expression patterns and the transcriptional responses of H. molitrix PHD genes to acute hypoxia, continued hypoxia, and reoxygenation were explored in different tissues. Our study preliminarily explored the physiological regulation functions of PHD genes at the transcriptional level when addressing the hypoxic challenge and provided a foundation for future systematic explorations of the molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxia adaptation in silver carp. As an economically and ecologically important freshwater fish, silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) is sensitive to low oxygen tension. Prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) proteins are critical regulators of adaptive responses to hypoxia for their function of regulating the hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha subunit (HIF-1 alpha) stability via hydroxylation reaction. In the present study, three PHD genes were cloned from H. molitrix by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The total length of HmPHD1, HmPHD2, and HmPHD3 were 2981, 1954, and 1847 base pair (bp), and contained 1449, 1080, and 738 bp open reading frames (ORFs) that encoded 482, 359, and 245 amino acids (aa), respectively. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that HmPHD1, HmPHD2, and HmPHD3 had the conserved prolyl 4-hydroxylase alpha subunit homolog domains at their C-termini. Meanwhile, the evaluation of phylogeny revealed PHD2 and PHD3 of H. molitrix were more closely related as they belonged to sister clades, whereas the clade of PHD1 was relatively distant from these two. The transcripts of PHD genes are ubiquitously distributed in H. molitrix tissues, with the highest expressional level of HmPHD1 and HmPHD3 in liver, and HmPHD2 in muscle. After acute hypoxic treatment for 0.5 h, PHD genes of H. molitrix were induced mainly in liver and brain, and different from HmPHD1 and HmPHD2, the expression of HmPHD3 showed no overt tissue specificity. Furthermore, under continued hypoxic condition, PHD genes exhibited an obviously rapid but gradually attenuated response from 3 h to 24 h, and upon reoxygenation, the transcriptional expression of PHD genes showed a decreasing trend in most of the tissues. These results indicate that the PHD genes of H. molitrix are involved in the early response to hypoxic stress, and they show tissue-specific transcript expression when performing physiological regulation functions. This study is of great relevance for advancing our understanding of how PHD genes are regulated when addressing the hypoxic challenge and provides a reference for the subsequent research of the molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxia adaptation in silver carp."

Most relevant models are nonlinear, however, and data available from real world ecosystems are too noisy and sparsely sampled for common inference approaches. Here we improved the inference of generalized Lotka–Volterra (gLV) ecological networks by using a new optimization algorithm to constrain parameter signs with prior knowledge and a perturbation-based ensemble method. Results We applied the new inference to long-term species abundance data from the freshwater fish community in the Illinois River, United States. We constructed an ensemble of 668 gLV models that explained 79% of the data on average. The models indicated (at a 70% level of confidence) a strong positive interaction from emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides) to channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), which we could validate using data from a nearby observation site, and predicted that the relative abundances of most fish species will continue to fluctuate temporally and concordantly in the near future. The network shows that the invasive silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) has much stronger impacts on native predators than on prey, supporting the notion that the invader perturbs the native food chain by replacing the diets of predators. Conclusions Ensemble approaches constrained by prior knowledge can improve inference and produce networks from noisy and sparsely sampled time series data to fill knowledge gaps on real world ecosystems. Such network models could aid efforts to conserve ecosystems such as the Illinois River, which is threatened by the invasion of the silver carp."

However, field investigations have showed that such stocking would enhance instead of controlling phyto-plankton in these reservoirs. Reservoirs generally receive a considerable amount of detritus from their catch-ments which may constitute an important carbon source to filter-feeding fish. Whether direct consumption of detritus increases the availability of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (P) to phytoplankton and thereby provides resilience against the control of phytoplankton biomass is debated. We conducted an enclosure experiment in a (sub)tropical Chinese reservoir (Liuxihe Reservoir) to assess how a gradient of filter-feeding fish (Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) biomass affected P dynamics and fish grazing and predation when subsidized by allochthonous detritus. Fish had strong effects on the dynamics and fluxes of P. TP concentration in the water column increased over time in all enclosures, but the presence of fish slowed its increase. Thus, TP decreased with increasing fish biomass. Fish were a net sink of P to the water column, because they gained mass during the experiment. Moreover, P sequestered by fish could largely account for the lower TP concentrations observed in enclosures with fish compared to fishless enclosures. Fish presence at high biomass strongly reduced the abundance of large zooplankton species and P excretion by zooplankton. However, the negative effect of fish predation on zooplankton was negligible when fish was present at low biomass. Increasing fish biomass increased the relative role of fish in P cycling but decreased the overall P excretion by fish and zooplankton. Compared to enclosures with high fish biomass, both zooplankton grazing effect on phytoplankton (zooplankton: phyto-plankton biomass ratio as a proxy) and the overall P excretion were much higher, whereas fish grazing effect on phytoplankton (fish: phytoplankton biomass ratio as a proxy), chlorophyll a and the yield of chlorophyll a per TP were much lower in enclosures with low fish biomass. This suggested that phytoplankton limitation might shift from one of zooplankton control to one of limitation by P availability with increasing fish biomass. Relative to fish mediated P recycling and fish grazing, zooplankton grazing appeared to be more important as a driver of trophic cascades in systems subsidized by allochthonous detritus. Silver Carp stocked at high biomass would strongly reduce zooplankton grazing pressure and increase the yield of phytoplankton per TP."

Bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) are two of the most important edible fish in Asia, which have a long juvenility period that can lasts for 4-5 years. In this study, we found one sex-specific marker by next-generation sequencing together with bioinformatics analysis in bighead carp. The male-specific markers were used to perform molecular sexing in the progenies of artificial gynogenetic diploids and found all progenies (n = 160) were females. Meanwhile, around 1 : 1 sex ratio was observed in a total of 579 juvenile offspring from three other families. To further extend the male-specific region, we performed genome walking and got a male-specific sequence of 8,661 bp. Five pairs of primers were designed and could be used to efficiently distinguish males from females in bighead carp and silver carp. The development of these male-specific markers and results of their molecular sexing in different populations provide strong evidence for a sex determination system of female homogametry or male heterogametry (XX/XY) in bighead carp and silver carp. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of effective sex-specific markers in these two large carp species."	"10.1093/dnares/dsx054"	"internal-pdf://3720933053/Liu-2018.pdf"

Bacterial diversity and richness in contents and mucus increased along the gut and were higher in contents than those in local mucus. A sequence analysis of gut samples exhibited the conservative phylotypes of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes. The gut of silver carp harbored an abundance of cellulolytic bacteria, particularly Clostridium XIV ab. The foregut segment had the highest proportions of the four cellulolytic bacteria, followed by the midgut and hindgut. However, the proportions of cellulolytic species in the silver carp gut was much lower than those in the terrestrial vertebrate gastrointestinal tract.

Results revealed that introduction of C. carpio and H. molitrix had a remarkable impact on the composition of bacterioplankton communities, and the BCC was significantly different between each treatment. Sequencing of DGGE bands revealed that the bacterioplankton community in the different treatment groups was consistent at a taxonomic level, but differed in its abundance.

Among various bacterial septicaemic diseases, fish mortality caused by Acinetobacter spp. is recently reported in different fish species. Fish disease outbreak was investigated in a wetland of West Bengal, India to identify the aetiological factors involved. The moribund fish were examined and subjected to bacterial isolation. Two bacterial causative agents were identified as Acinetobacter junii and Acinetobacter pittii by biochemical characterization and 16S rRNA gene amplification. Both the isolates were oxidase‐negative, nitrate‐negative, catalase‐positive and indole‐negative. The molecular identification using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic tree analysis further confirmed the two Acinetobacter spp. with 97%–99% similarity. The antibiotic resistance patterns of these two bacteria revealed that both of them were resistant to β‐lactam, cefalexin, cephalothin, amoxyclav, cefuroxime, cefadroxil, clindamycin, vancomycin and penicillin. In addition, A. pittii was also resistant to other antibiotics of cephams group such as ceftazidime and cefotaxime. In the challenge experiment, both A. junii and A. pittii were found to be pathogenic with LD50 of 1.24 × 105 and 1.88 × 107 cfu/fish respectively. Histopathological examination of gill, liver and kidney revealed prominent changes supporting bacterial septicaemia. The investigation reports for the first time on concurrent infection by A. junii and multidrug‐resistant (MDR)‐A. pittii as emerging fish pathogens to cause severe mortality in Labeo catla and Hypophthalmichthys molitrix in a freshwater wetland."

Distinct niches of these two species lead to differences in their ecological function. Here, high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene was employed to investigate and compare the bacterial community and potential function of silver carp and bighead carp reared in aquaculture pond systems. We found no significant difference in alpha diversity between microbial community of water body and intestinal microbiota of silver carp and bighead carp. Bacterial community richness of bighead carp, however, was higher than that of silver carp. A significant separation between microbial community of water body and of two fish species was observed. The Norank_o_PeM15, norank_f_Alcaligenaceae and unclassified_p_Firmicutes were higher for bighead carp but only Pseudomonas was higher for silver carp. Compared with bighead carp, intestinal microbiota of silver carp also had less typical planktonic bacteria. A separation but non-significant of bacterial community between silver carp and bighead carp was observed. In terms of predicted community function for water body, except for the lower abundance of cell motility than silver carp, the other pathways were generally more enriched than the two fish species. For the comparison between silver carp and bighead carp, most metabolic pathways, e.g., nutrients transport and metabolism, were generally more enriched for silver carp. The results of this study gain a better appreciation of gut microbiome ecology relating to pond culture of two species of microphagic filter feeding carps, which could be effectively used in the management of these two species to enhance production and health."

These data come from survey or monitoring efforts that use a wide variety of tools. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a surveillance tool that uses genetic markers for detecting species and holds potential as a tool for large-scale monitoring programs. Two challenges of eDNA-based studies are uncertainties created by imperfect capture of eDNA in collection samples (e.g., water field samples) and imperfect detection of eDNA using molecular methods (e.g., quantitative PCR). Occurrence models can be used to address these challenges, thus we use an occurrence model to address two objectives: first, to determine how many samples were required to detect species using eDNA; second, to examine when and where to take samples. We collected water samples from three different habitat types in the Upper Mississippi River when both Bighead Carp and Silver Carp were known to be present based on telemetry detections. Each habitat type (backwater, tributary, and impoundment) was sampled during April, May, and November. Detections of eDNA for both species varied across sites and months, but were generally low, 0-19.3% of samples were positive for eDNA. Overall, we found that eDNA-based sampling holds promise to be a powerful monitoring tool for resource managers; however, limitations of eDNA-based sampling include different biological and ecological characteristics of target species such as seasonal habitat usage patterns as well as aspects of different physical environments that impact the implementation of these methods such as water temperature."

We investigated Silver Carp diets in a backwater lake of the Lower Mississippi River in order to quantify phytoplankton prey selectivity. We made measurements on 4 dates over a 2-y period, which spanned a range of hydrologic connectivity between the lake and the river and a variety of fish sizes. We quantified selection by comparing phytoplankton community composition in the lake to prey in foreguts of captured Silver Carp using Vanderploeg and Scavia's (1979) relativized selection index. With a possible exception of diatoms on 1 date, there was no relationship of sample date or fish size on prey selection. However, there was a consistent pattern in prey selection: euglenoid algae were positively selected, selection of colonial algae and diatoms was variable, and flagellates and filamentous cyanobacteria were negatively selected.

We used Mississippi River Basin fish community data collected by the Long Term Resource Monitoring program and the Missouri Department of Conservation to evaluate possible interaction between Asian Carp and native fishes. Results from two decades of long-term monitoring throughout much of the Mississippi River suggest that Silver Carp relative abundance has increased while relative abundance (Bigmouth Buffalo [F (3, 8240) = 6.44, P<0.01] and Gizzard Shad [F (3, 8240) = 31.04, P<0.01]) and condition (Bigmouth Buffalo [slope = -0.11; t = -1.71; P = 0.1014] and Gizzard Shad [slope = -0.39; t = -3.02; P = 0.0073]) of native planktivores have declined. Floodplain lake qualitative evaluations yielded similar results; floodplain lake fish communities were likely altered (i.e., reductions in native species) by Silver Carp. Furthermore, laboratory experiments corroborated field evidence; Silver Carp negatively influence native planktivores through competition for prey (all comparisons, P > 0.05). To this end, this study provides evidence that Silver Carp are likely adversely influencing native fishes; however, mere presence of Silver Carp in the system does not induce deleterious effects on native fishes. To the best of our knowledge, this evaluation is the first to describe the effects of Asian Carp throughout the Mississippi River Basin and could be used to reduce the effects of Asian Carp on native biota through an integrated pest management program as suggested by congressional policy. Despite the simplicity of the data analyzed and approach used, this study provides a framework for beginning to identify the interactions of invasive fish pests on native fishes (i.e., necessary first step of integrated pest management). However, knowledge gaps remain. We suggest future efforts should conduct more in depth analyses (i.e., multivariate statistical approaches) that investigate the influence on all native species."

In view of the above, the susceptibility of three carp species, namely catla (Catla catla), mrigal (Cirrhinus mrigala) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) was evaluated vis-a-vis tilapia, following experimental infection with TiLV. No clinical signs and histopathological alterations could be observed in carps. RT-qPCR revealed that TiLV copy numbers in liver and brain of all the three carps were almost negligible and did not show any increase with time, suggesting that the virus did not replicate in liver and brain, the target organs of TiLV. Further, TiLV could not be isolated from pooled liver and brain tissues of carps using permissive CFF cell line. On the contrary, in tilapia, typical clinical signs and histopathological lesions were observed and there was significant increase in TiLV copy number up to 6 days post-injection. Furthermore, the virus was successfully isolated from pooled liver and brain tissue of infected tilapia. From the above findings, it could be concluded that C. catla, C. mrigala and H. molitrix are resistant to TiLV infection and unlikely to be carriers for this virus."

Hypophthalmichthys molitrix"	"Unregulated rivers provide unobstructed corridors for the dispersal of both native and invasive species. We sought to evaluate range size and habitat use of an invasive species (Silver Carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) in an unimpounded river reach (Wabash River, IN), to provide insights into the dispersal of invasive species and their potential overlap with native species. We hypothesized that range size would increase with fish length, be similar among sexes, and vary annually while habitats used would be deeper, warmer, lower velocity, and of finer substrate. Silver Carp habitat use supported our hypotheses but range size did not vary with sex or length. 75% home range varied annually, suggesting that core areas occupied by individuals may change relative to climate-based factors (e.g., water levels), whereas broader estimates of range size remained constant across years. Ranges were often centered on landscape features such as tributaries and backwaters. Results of this study indicate habitat and landscape features as potential areas where Silver Carp impacts on native ecosystems may be the greatest. Observed distribution of range sizes indicates the presence of sedentary and mobile individuals within the population. Mobile individuals may be of particular importance as they drive the spread of the invasive species into new habitats."	"10.1007/s10750-017-3296-y"	"internal-pdf://2398257485/Prechtel-2018.pdf"

There are numerous fish species and due to their close resemblance with each other, it is difficult to classify them by external characters. Recently, computer vision and deep learning-based identification of different animal species is being widely used by the researchers. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most analytically powerful tools in deep learning architecture for the image classification based on visual features. This work aims to propose a deep learning framework based on the CNN method for fish species identification. The proposed CNN architecture contains 32 deep layers that are considerably deep to derive valuable and discriminating features from the image. The deep supervision is inflicted on the VGGNet architecture to increase the classification performance by instantly adding four convolutional layers to the training of each level in the network. To test the performance of proposed 32-Layer CNN architecture, we developed a dataset termed as Fish-Pak and is publicly available at Mendeley data (Fish-Pak: https://doi.org/10.17632/n3ydw29sbz.3#folder-6b024354-bae3-460a-a758-352685ba0e38) . Fish-Pak contains 915 images with six distinct classes; Ctenopharyngodon idella (Grass carp), Cyprinus carpio (Common carp), Cirrhinus mrigala (Mori), Labeo rohita (Rohu), Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Silver carp), and Catla catla (Thala) and three different image views (head region, body shape, and scale). To ensure the superior performance of proposed CNN architecture, we have carried out the experimental comparison with other deep learning frameworks involving VGG-16 for transfer learning, one block VGG, two block VGG, three block VGG, LeNet-5, AlexNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet-50 on the Fish-Pak data set. Comprehensive empirical analyses reveal that the proposed method achieves state of the art performance and outperforms existing methods."

The results indicated that MC-LR content in water ranged from 0.18 to 3.02 mu g/L in dissolved fraction and undetectable level to 1.13 mu g/L in cellular fraction, in all three seasons. The results of PCA revealed that the environmental parameters including EC, Chl-a, PO43-, pH and temperature were the most effective factors influencing the MC-LR production. Results further showed the mean concentration of MC-LR in muscle and liver of silver carp ranged from 10.12 to 40.98 and from undetectable to 44.34 mu g/kg w.w, respectively.

Sampling commenced 2 h prior to sunset and continued into the night, not exceeding 5 h beyond sunset. Model selection showed that all temporal and spatial factors were important. Post hoc analysis revealed that Silver Carp CPUE was higher at night (beyond 1 h after sunset), in shoreline habitat, and in water generally no deeper than 5 m. Seasonal variation in CPUE occurred, but in general the CPUE was high in the fall for all locations. Considering these results for management application, we estimated the sampling effort required to reach precise CPUE and adequately assess size structure (125 stock-length fish) in shoreline habitat at night. These sampling objectives were attainable in the spring and fall seasons for all locations (4-31 deployments) but were more variable in summer. We recommend consideration of the paupier as a standard method to sample Silver Carp in large lentic habitats by using the guidelines provided herein (i.e., sampling of the shoreline beyond 1 h after sunset during the fall season).

Keywords: Algeria, Hypophthalmichtys molitrix, Kherrata Reservoir, limiting factors, reproduction, seasonal changes Introduction Silver carp, Hypophthalmichtys molitrix (Val.), is one of the most important freshwater fish species in aquaculture. Despite the fact that silver carp has been introduced in many countries of the world for biological control (algal blooms) and aquaculture, natural reproduction is only observed in limited localities in ecosystems similar to those of the original environment (Kolar et al. 2005). The sections were mounted on glass microscope slides, stained with hematoxylin-eosin, and then examined and photographed with an Optika DM binocular digital microscope (2.0 Mpx)."

Consequently, concerns regarding the human health impact of long-term consumption of fish from the Olifants River have been raised in recent studies. Nevertheless, Lake Flag Boshielo situated on the main stem of the Olifants River has been proposed as a site for an inland fishery. Planktivorous silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Valenciennes, 1844) is among the potential target species for such a fishery. Therefore, a desk-top human health risk assessment was conducted for silver carp from Lake Flag Boshielo. From January to November 2013, muscle samples from 50 specimens were collected and analysed for metals and metalloids. The hazard quotient based on a weekly meal of 150 g exceeded the acceptable level for As, Cd, Cr, Co, Pb, Hg, Se, V and Zn. Compared with previous studies from Lake Flag Boshielo, muscle tissue concentrations of As, Cr, Pb, Hg, Se, V and Zn for H. molitrix were higher. Based on the metal and metalloid concentrations reported in this study, long-term consumption of silver carp from Lake Flag Boshielo might pose a health risk to impoverished rural communities."

Gear comparisons are often required to determine the most effective techniques. Such is the case for populations of invasive Asian carps Hypophthalmichthys spp., which have recently occurred in large numbers throughout sections of the Mississippi River basin. We tested five gears (mini‐fyke nets, beach seine, purse seine, pulsed‐DC electrofishing, and gill net) that targeted juvenile (age 0) Silver Carp H. molitrix at sites along the Illinois River during 2014 and 2015 to determine the most effective ones for age‐0 Silver Carp. We considered the most cost‐effective gear to be the one that provided the largest catch at a minimal expenditure of labor. Mini‐fyke nets were the most effective at collecting large numbers of age‐0 Silver Carp, followed in decreasing order by beach seines, pulsed‐DC electrofishing, purse seines, and gill nets. The smallest Silver Carp were caught in beach seines and the largest were caught in gill nets, and there was considerable variation in size distributions among gears. However, when we considered cost‐effectiveness in terms of labor hours for each gear, both beach seines and mini‐fyke nets had similar and overlapping labor expenditures. Gill nets and purse seines were not cost‐effective, as they required more labor and had lower overall catch rates.

To better understand the hydraulics associated with substrate on fish swimming, we studied the effects of a vertical half cylinder (hereafter, cylinder) on the critical swimming speed of juvenile silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). Absolute and relative critical swimming speeds of fish in the flow field of the cylinder were significantly increased compared with those swimming in free flow. In addition, the amplitude of fish head and tail oscillations were significantly greater in flows created by the half cylinder. This study highlights the importance of roughness elements in stream microhabitat restoration and, possibly, for fishway design."	"10.1002/rra.3416"	"internal-pdf://0181266485/Senfan-2019.pdf"

Hypophthalmichthys molitrix"	"Turbulence is a complex hydraulic phenomenon which commonly occurs in natural streams and fishways. Riverine fish are subjected to heterogeneous flow velocities and turbulence, which may affect their movements and ability to pass the fishways. However, studies focusing on fish response to turbulent flows are lacking for many species. Here we investigate the effects of the turbulence created by a vertical half‐cylinder of various diameters (1.9, 2.5, 3.2 and 5.0 cm) on the swimming ability and behaviour of silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix. The large D‐cylinders (3.0 and 5.0 cm) create specific vorticity and reduced velocities areas in their vicinity, which favours flow refuging behaviours (FRBs) and thus increased relative critical swimming speeds (Urcrit, BL/s) of silver carp, by comparison to free‐flow conditions and cylinders of smaller diameter (1.9 and 2.5 cm). The flow speed at which silver carp maximized FRBs such as Karman gaiting downstream of the cylinder, holding position in the bow wake or entraining on the side ranged from 40 to 70 cm s−1, depending on fish body size. When holding station near a cylinder under optimal flow speeds, the distance between the fish and the cylinder is related to the size of the fish, but also to the size of the cylinder and the produced vortices. The optimal holding region in the drag wake of the cylinder ranged from 28 to 40 cm downstream of the centre of the cylinder, depending on the size of the fish. Smaller fish, however, tend to use the reduced velocities areas located in the bow wake of the large cylinders. We hypothesize that fish will display FRBs, including maintaining a Karman gait in turbulent flow, when the ratio of the cylinder diameter to their body length is between 1:3 and 1:4. They also match their tail beat frequency to the vortex shedding frequency of the cylinder. Our results provide a better understanding of how silver carp respond to turbulent flows around physical structures, with implications for the design of nature‐like fishways or exclusion devices in both its native and invasive ranges."

Hypophthalmichthys molitrix"	"We currently have only a minimal understanding of energy‐saving strategies of fish in unsteady flows. In this study, we found that obstacle shape can affect swimming ability of fish: our results suggested that a half cylinder improved critical swimming speed of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) compared with swimming downstream of a full cylinder, square tube or for free‐flow conditions. We also discovered how silver carp alter their locomotory behavior in response to turbulent flow caused by varying flow velocities around obstacles. At a flow velocity of 1 BL/s (body length per second), the fish spent similar percentages of time between holding station and moving forward behind the half cylinder: their motions resembled freestream swimming behavior. The greatest percentage of time spent downstream of the half cylinder occurred at a flow velocity of 5 BL/s. Fish were unstable and displayed irregular body motions with large lateral displacement at 5 BL/s. However, the fish held station for a long time and moved forward steadily behind the half cylinder at 3 BL/s. In holding station behind the half cylinder, fish maintained constant tail‐beat frequency and tail‐ beat amplitude when flow velocity was increased from 1 to 3 BL/s. In moving forward behind the half cylinder, fish increased tail‐beat frequency and tail‐beat amplitude while maintaining constant ground swimming speed, swimming acceleration and ground stride when flow velocity was increased from 3 to 5 BL/s. Moreover, fish positioned their snouts in a small area approximately 1–3 BL downstream from the half cylinder at 3 BL/s. These behaviors support the hypothesis that turbulence behind a half cylinder was a suitable location for fish to conserve energy at 3 BL/s. Our results indicate that the combined effect of obstacles and flow velocity influence fish locomotory behavior, and some combinations may be beneficial to fish energy expenditure swimming in unsteady flow."

The use of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) to reduce excessive phytoplankton development is controversial. In the case of cyanobacteria, many of which are toxic, understanding their possible digestion mechanism by fish is particularly desirable. A unique methodical approach, which consists of applying intestinal contents or extracts to a cyanobacteria culture, was used. Unicellular cyanobacteria (Cyanothece) were incubated in vitro with bile, contents of different parts of the intestinal tract, and cytosolic and microsomal extracts of the intestinal tissue of silver carp. The abundance of cyanobacteria decreased in all treatments containing either exclusively bile or its combination with intestinal contents. This research provides the first evidence of non-mechanical digestion of cyanobacteria by silver carp. Cyanobacteria incubated with intestinal contents or extracts reached mostly higher abundances than those incubated with the nutrient medium. The existence of non-mechanical digestion mediated via intestinal contents and extracts or its compensation connected with organic substance uptake is discussed."

A radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) model was established to predict the changes in the microbial content of silver carp. The critical temperature for inactivation of Enterobacteriaceae and lactic acid bacteria was 65 °C and for Pseudomonas and Psychrotrophs was 70 °C and the highest value (75 °C) was observed for the total viable count. In samples processed at 75 °C, the presence of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas and Psychrotrophs were not detectable up to 15 days of storage and lactic acid bacteria were not detectable even at the end of the storage period. The optimal ANN topology for modeling Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, and Psychrotroph contained 9 neurons in the hidden layer, but for TVC and LAB, it was 14 neurons."

However, the benefit of stocking silver carp to restore eutrophic lakes remains controversial and the reasons for the different responses observed are unclear. In this study, we conducted an outdoor experiment to assess the impact of the biomass level of four silver carp (c. 0, 25, 50, and 100 g/m(3)) on phytoplankton through direct grazing and fish-mediated nutrient recycling, respectively. We used a nested design with nutrient-permeable chambers with or without fish placed inside ponds. In this way, the phytoplankton incubated outside the chambers was affected by both consumer grazing and nutrient recycling, whereas the phytoplankton inside the fish-free chambers was only affected by consumer-mediated nutrient recycling. Outside the chambers, the concentrations of total nitrogen, dissolved total nitrogen, and total phosphorus did not differ significantly among the treatments, whereas the dissolved total phosphorus level was significantly higher in the fishless treatment. The concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl a), phytoplankton biomass and the ratio of nanophytoplankton Chl a to total phytoplankton Chl a in the fish-present treatments were significantly higher than in the fishless treatment and the phytoplankton was dominated by small-sized species. While the zooplankton biomass and zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratio were significantly lower in the fish-present treatments, indicating a strong fish predation on zooplankton. As for the water inside the chambers, there was no significant difference among the four treatments for any of the measured variables except total phosphorus. Our results suggest that silver carp indirectly stimulated phytoplankton growth by reducing the zooplankton grazing rather than through nutrient recycling, and that fish grazing on phytoplankton could not compensate for the loss of grazing by zooplankton, leading to higher phytoplankton biomass when silver carp was present. The benefit of using filter-feeding fish as a biomanipulation tool to create clear water is therefore questionable unless control of nanophytoplankton can be achieved."

Traditional analyses often assume uncorrelated or weakly correlated temporal structure in fisheries data time series. We propose that frequency and scale domain methods, in the form of wavelet transforms, can serve as useful probes in early investigations of fisheries data, finding out the mechanisms underlying the changes in the diversity and abundance of fishes. We used cross-wavelet analysis with phase angle and coherency parameters to study the effect of discharge on the occurrence of silver carp larvae in a large subtropical river. Simulation studies show that the spectral signature given by the cross-wavelet method provided a useful approach for statistically detecting and characterizing temporal dependency in the occurrence of fish larvae. In addition, our simulations provide an objective, quantitative basis for understanding how river flow rate acts as a trigger for the occurrence of larvae. And our results can be used to ecological operation silver carp larvae were found when discharge was greater than 10(4) m(3) s(-1). The flood peak persists for some days (at least 2 days) and can induce a peak in larval abundance. Our analyses also show that flood duration and the flood total volume decreased from 2006 to 2013. Moreover the flood occurred earlier each year. This may be why the period of most intense spawning (the day of maximum larvae collected) was earlier each year. We conclude with a discussion about the role wavelet analysis may have in appropriately guiding flexible probabilistic models connecting fisheries with environmental covariates. The wavelet approach is an especially promising tool for analyzing ecological data, such as the relationship between hydrological conditions and fish larva occurrence."

However, traditional capture-based morphological surveys require considerable taxonomic expertise, are time consuming and expensive, can kill rare taxa and damage habitats, and often are prone to false negatives. Alternatively, metabarcoding assays can be used to assess the genetic identity and compositions of entire communities from environmental samples, comprising a more sensitive, less damaging, and relatively time- and cost-efficient approach. However, there is a trade-off between the stringency of bioinformatic filtering needed to remove false positives and the potential for false negatives. The present investigation thus evaluated use of four mitochondrial (mt) DNA metabarcoding assays and a customized bioinformatic Bioinformatic pipeline to increase confidence in species identifications by removing false positives, while achieving high detection probability. Positive controls were used to calculate sequencing error, and results that fell below those cutoff values were removed, unless found with multiple assays. The performance of this approach was tested to discern and identify North American freshwater fishes using lab experiments (mock communities and aquarium experiments) and processing of a bulk ichthyoplankton sample. The method then was applied to field environmental (e) DNA water samples taken concomitant with electrofishing surveys and morphological identifications. This protocol detected 100% of species present in concomitant electrofishing surveys in the Wabash River and an additional 21 that were absent from traditional sampling. Using single 1 L water samples collected from just four locations, the metabarcoding assays discerned 73% of the total fish species that were discerned during four months of an extensive electrofishing river survey in the Maumee River, along with an additional nine species. In both rivers, total fish species diversity was best resolved when all four metabarcoding assays were used together, which identified 35 additional species missed by electrofishing. Ecological distinction and diversity levels among the fish communities also were better resolved with the metabarcoding assays than with morphological sampling and identifications, especially using all four assays together. At the population-level, metabarcoding analyses targeting the invasive round goby Neogobius melanostomus and the silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix identified all population haplotype variants found using Sanger sequencing of morphologically sampled fish, along with additional intra-specific diversity, meriting further investigation. Overall findings demonstrated that the use of multiple metabarcoding assays and custom bioinformatics that filter potential error from true positive detections improves confidence in evaluating biodiversity."

Optimizing eDNA sampling protocols can be challenging because there is imperfect understanding of how each step of the protocol influences its sensitivity. This paper develops a probabilistic model that characterizes each step of an eDNA sampling protocol to evaluate the protocol's overall detection sensitivity for one sample. The model is then applied to analyse how changes over time made to the eDNA sampling protocol to detect bighead (BH) and silver carp (SC) eDNA have influenced its sensitivity, and hence interpretation of the results. The model shows that changes to the protocol have caused the sensitivity of the protocol to fluctuate. A more efficient extraction method in 2013, new species-specific markers with a qPCR assay in 2014, and a more efficient capture method in 2015 have improved the sensitivity, while switching to a larger elution volume in 2013 and a smaller sample volume in 2015 have reduced the sensitivity. Overall, the sensitivity of the current protocol is higher for BH eDNA detection and SC eDNA detection compared to the original protocol used from 2009 to 2012.

One confounding factor when interpreting eDNA sampling evidence is that eDNA can be present in the water in the absence of living target organisms, originating from excreta, dead tissue, boats, or sewage effluent, etc. In the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS), electric fish dispersal barriers were built to prevent non-native Asian carp species from invading Lake Michigan, and yet Asian carp eDNA has been detected above the barriers sporadically since 2009. In this paper the influence of stream flow characteristics in the CAWS on the probability of invasive Asian carp eDNA detection in the CAWS from 2009 to 2012 was examined. In the CAWS, the direction of stream flow is mostly away from Lake Michigan, though there are infrequent reversals in flow direction towards Lake Michigan during dry spells. We find that the flow reversal volume into the Lake has a statistically significant positive relationship with eDNA detection probability, while other covariates, like gage height, precipitation, season, water temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, pH and chlorophyll concentration do not. This suggests that stream flow direction is highly influential on eDNA detection in the CAWS and should be considered when interpreting eDNA evidence. We also find that the beta-binomial regression model provides a stronger fit for eDNA detection probability compared to a binomial regression model. This paper provides a statistical modeling framework for interpreting eDNA sampling evidence and for evaluating covariates influencing eDNA detection. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Using electro-olfactogram recording (EOG), we found that the olfactory system of this species is acutely sensitive to three F-series prostaglandins (PGFs) at picomolar concentrations and that this sensitivity is enhanced when juveniles are masculinized using androgens, consistent with expectations of a sex pheromone. Individual PGFs had behavioral activity but it was low, suggesting a mixture might be important. To pursue this possibility, we implanted carps with osmotic pumps containing prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α), a treatment previously shown to elicit release of a PGF-based spawning pheromone in the Common Carp. We found that PGF2α-implanted Silver Carp released a species-specific odor that contained a blend of PGF2α and two of its metabolites, which masculinized individuals detected and were attracted to with high sensitivity. Finally, we found that a mixture of these PGFs was attractive to masculinized Silver Carp, while a different mixture released by Bighead Carp was not. We conclude that Silver Carp likely use a species-specific PGF2α-derived sex pheromone that is probably released at spawning and might be useful in its control. Confirmatory studies that explore pheromone function in naturally mature Silver Carp using natural odors in the field should now be conducted to further confirm our proof-of-concept study."

Using boat-mounted cameras, we recorded video of invasive Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix in the field as they were leaping from the water and measured their leap height, horizontal distance, and angle of escape and estimated their escape velocity. Leap characteristics, fish morphometrics, and environmental data were measured from populations of carp in Mississippi, Missouri, and Illinois. The means for leap height and distance (+/- SE) across all of the study areas were 125 +/- 5.54 and 209 +/- 9.10 cm, respectively. The maximum leap height that was recorded was 276.08 cm (in Ramsey Creek, Missouri), and the maximum distance was 482.34 cm (in DeSoto Lake, Mississippi), both more than double the mean values. The majority of carp (66.1%) leaped at angles between 46 degrees and 65 degrees. The mean water escape velocities (WEV) varied across the three study sites. The velocities in Missouri, 628.4 +/- 31.6 cm/s, were significantly higher than they were in Mississippi, 471.2 +/- 16.9 cm/s or in Illinois, 551.7 +/- 20.6 cm/s. The maximum measured escape velocity was 771 cm/s, but the maximum estimated WEV was substantially higher at 1,280 cm/s. Larger Silver Carp were captured at lower latitudes: 54.79 +/- 0.74 cm in Illinois, 60.86 +/- 0.75 cm in Missouri, and 73.09 +/- 1.03 cm in Mississippi. A regression analysis indicated that leap distance and height were correlated with fish size, escape velocity, and angle of escape and that escape velocity was correlated with streamflow velocity, fish size, and water temperature. This study provides a first-time quantification of the leap characteristics and escape velocities of Silver Carp, which we believe approximates their maximum burst swim speeds. Therefore, these data can be used to develop or refine effective vertical and hydraulic barriers to the dispersal of Silver Carp. The data also demonstrate that the leaping and high-speed swimming capabilities of Silver Carp are greater than has been assumed previously."

Management of any species relies on an accurate understanding of population characteristics and dynamics. However, Silver Carp seasonal sampling variation is unknown. Sampling during periods of peak catch rates would facilitate Silver Carp assessment and management, improving monitoring and removal techniques. The objective of this study was to evaluate adult Silver Carp seasonal sampling variation with boat electroshocking and trammel nets. Silver Carp were collected monthly (April-October) during 2014 and 2015 from four locations in the Des Moines River, Iowa. Trammel nets rarely captured Silver Carp (mean +/- SE = 4.9 +/- 1.6 fish/net; 60% of fish were captured in 6.3% of net sets) and therefore were not included in analyses. Electroshocking catch rates (CPUEs) exhibited a bimodal distribution, with peak CPUEs generally occurring in May, June, and September and lower catch rates observed during July and August. Catch rates were positively related to river discharge at upstream sites but not at downstream sites. Silver Carp size structure was similar among months and sites except at Cliffland, where fish were smaller during August and October compared to earlier in the year. Finally, Silver Carp condition peaked during April and May and decreased throughout the year except at Keokuk, where peaks were observed during both May and August. Although spatiotemporal variability was substantial, these results suggest that sampling of Silver Carp via electroshocking in May-June and September-October generally produces higher catch rates compared to July-August sampling and generates a more representative size structure. Using site-specific knowledge, monitoring and surveillance programs could more effectively sample during these periods of high vulnerability and densities in order to manage the spread and impacts of Silver Carp at statewide and regionwide scales."

Year-class strength (YCS) and synchrony of nine populations (maximum linear distance=806.4km) were indexed using catch-curve residuals correlated between sites and related to local and regional climatic conditions. Overall, Silver Carp YCS was not synchronous among populations, suggesting that local environmental factors are more important determinants of YCS than large-scale environmental factors. Variation in Silver Carp YCS was influenced by river base flow and discharge variability at each site, indicating that extended periods of static local discharge benefit YCS. Furthermore, river discharge and air temperature were correlated and synchronized among sites, butonly similarities in river discharge were correlated with Silver Carp population synchrony, indicating thatsimilarities in discharge (i.e., major flood) among sites can positively synchronize Silver Carp YCS.

Established populations of invasive silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix are currently found throughout a large portion of the upper Mississippi River (UMR) basin. Despite their recent invasion and broad environmental tolerances, silver carp population ecology and linkages to environmental conditions in the UMR remain understudied. There were two objectives for this investigation: (a) to estimate correlations among population characteristics and the influence of latitude and the time since first detection, and (b) to model the influence of river discharge and temperature on growth early in life to age 3. We estimated spatial variability in silver carp population characteristics and dynamics from nine sites across the UMR and assessed if biotic, abiotic or invasion-related (time since first detection) variables influence spatial patterns. Silver carp body weight, size structure, annual mortality, and growth parameters varied among locations. Silver carp recruitment was less stable for populations with higher relative abundance estimates and where carp were first detected >= 20 years ago whereas maximum carp age decreased with increasing latitude. Although model selection indicated silver carp length at age 3 was associated with mean daily discharge (m(3)/s) coefficient of variation, mean May-June temperatures, and ordinal date of maximum discharge, parameter coefficients and effect sizes were small and not biologically meaningful. Our results suggest that silver carp populations are governed by intraspecific mechanisms, but time-dependent changes in populations may partially underpin heterogeneity across populations. Our study helped further disentangle silver carp population ecology in the UMR by understanding carp ecology as a function of their invasion."

The results showed that the critical and burst swimming speed (m/s) of the four carps increased with the increased body length, and the relative (critical and burst) swimming speed (the critical and burst swimming speed divided by the body length, BL/s) decreases with body length. The critical and burst swimming speed of each species at two individual length groups (1.0–5.0 cm, 5.1–9.0 cm) was significantly different (p < 0.05), and the water velocities in fish passage should be less than the fish burst swimming speed.

Based on receiver operative characteristic curve analysis, thresholds were identified to distinguish between low, medium and high risk species. The "top invasive" (very high risk) species identified were: brown bullhead Ameiurus nebulosus, blue crab Callinectes sapidus, gibel carp Carassius gibelio, Philippine catfish Clarias batrachus, Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis, bluespotted cornetfish Fistularia commersonii, silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, silver-cheeked toadfish Lagocephalus sceleratus, half-smooth golden pufferfish Lagocephalus spadiceus, Suez pufferfish Lagocephalus suezensis, signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus, fathead minnow Pimephales promelas, channeled applesnail Pomacea canaliculata, red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii, devil firefish Pterois miles and European catfish Silurus glanis.

Region-specific risk screenings, as implemented in this study, are therefore essential for setting priorities in preventative management for the conservation of key biodiversity hotspots and the optimal allocation of resources in view of full risk assessment for the species identified as (very) high risk."

The potential for elevated CO2 to have similar negative impacts on freshwater communities remains understudied. The objective of our study was to quantify the effects of elevated CO2 on the behaviors of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) following exposure to conspecific skin extracts (alarm cues). In fathead minnows, their response to conspecific skin extracts was significantly impaired following exposure to elevated CO2 levels for at least 96 h, while silver carp behaviors were unaltered. However, fathead minnow behaviors did return to pre-CO2 exposure in high-CO2-exposed fish following 14 days of holding at ambient CO2 levels. Overall, this study suggests there may be potential impacts to freshwater fishes alarm cue behaviors following CO2 exposure, but these responses may be species-specific and will likely be abated should the CO2 stressor be removed."

Because silver carp remove plankton and other particles from the water column, they may compete with mussels for food resources. This would be among the first examples of a direct competitive interaction between fish and mussels. To examine the potential for competition, a 30 day tank experiment was performed with 2 year old fatmucket mussels (Lampsilis siliquoidea Barnes, 1823) and age-1 silver carp in three treatments: fatmucket only, silver carp only and fatmucket + silver carp. All tanks were given a commercial algal-based diet daily and dry mass of suspended particles (an estimate of available food) and NH4, NO3 and NO2 concentrations were quantified every 5 days to track food availability and changes in nutrients. Initial and final silver carp total length (mm) and mass (g), and fatmucket length (mm), height (mm) and surface area (cm(2)) were measured. Survival was 100% over the test duration for both species. Fatmucket grew less in the fatmucket + silver carp treatment, whereas silver carp growth was undetectable regardless of treatment. Fatmucket also exhibited increased movement in the presence of silver carp. Suspended particles did not differ among treatments. Dissolved nitrogen concentrations were higher in the silver carp treatments, suggesting that silver carp increase nutrient availability in aquatic systems. Overall, the slower growth rates observed in the fatmucket + silver carp treatment compared with the mussel-only treatment suggest exploitative competition between invasive planktivorous silver carp and fatmucket, and this competition may contribute to additional stress on already imperilled mussels."

Silver carp (Hypophthalmicthys molitrix), an invasive cyprinid in North America, display wide variation in reproductive strategies across both their native and introduced ranges, though the specifics of silver carp reproduction in the Illinois River have not been established. We assessed reproductive status using histological and endocrinological methods in silver carp between April and October 2018, with additional histological data from August to October 2017. Here, we show that female silver carp are batch spawners with asynchronous, indeterminate oocyte recruitment, while male silver carp utilize a determinate pattern of spermatogenesis which ceases in the early summer. High plasma testosterone levels in females could be responsible for regulating oocyte development. Our results suggest that silver carp have high spawning activity in the early summer (May-June), but outside of the peak spawning period, female silver carp can maintain spawning-capable status by adjusting rates of gametogenesis and atresia in response to environmental conditions, while males regress their gonads as early as July.

In this study, we analyzed patterns of early summer chlorophyll-a in a large-river reservoir in response to invasion of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). We used 25 years of ecological data from a 30-km reach of Kentucky Lake collected before and after silver carp establishment. We found significant decreases in chlorophyll-a within certain reservoir habitats since establishment of silver carp. Additionally, environmental and biological drivers of phytoplankton production showed no significant differences before and after invasion. These results suggest seasonal, and habitat-specific consumptive effects of invasive silver carp on an important basal food web resource. Further, our results convey the utility of long-term quantitative biological and physiochemical data in understanding ecosystem responses to elements of global change (i.e., species invasions). Importantly, the observed changes in the basal food web resource of Kentucky Lake may apply to other ecosystems facing invasion by silver carp (e.g., Laurentian Great Lakes). Our study offers insight into the mechanisms by which silver carp may influence ecosystems and furthers our understanding of invasive omnivores."

However, the role of endozoochory in the context of invasive species is considered less often. Throughout the United States, Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) are prolific invaders that often alter food web structure of recipient ecosystems through the consumption of basal resources. Despite the biogeochemical and food web effects of Silver Carp, there is limited understanding of plankton prey survival after Silver Carp consumption and digestion, and even less known about the ecological effects of selective diets and potential survival. In this study, we quantify hindgut contents of Silver Carp collected from Kentucky Lake, Kentucky, Tennessee River Valley, United States. We found the majority (83%) of phytoplankters within hindguts of Silver Carp showed little digestion prior to egestion. Our study suggests digestion limitations of Silver Carp may have important ecological implications for invaded environments. These results may be applicable in understanding how this rapidly spreading invasive fish can influence food web dynamics and biogeochemical cycles pertinent to toxic algal blooms within recently invaded ecosystems, and forecasting invasion in the near future."

Broadband sound recorded from an outboard motor (100 hp at 32 km/hr) can modulate their behavior in captivity; however, the response of wild silver carp to broadband sound has yet to be determined. In this experiment, broadband sound (0.06-10 kHz) elicited jumping behavior from silver carp in the Spoon River near Havana, IL independent of boat movement, indicating acoustic stimulus alone is sufficient to induce jumping. Furthermore, the number of jumping fish decreased with subsequent sound exposures.

These fish are well known for their airborne leaps in response to passing watercraft, but the trigger for, and functional significance of jumping remains unknown. The behavior of wild silver carp responding to moving (16, 24, 32, and 40 km/hr) 6 m aluminum boats equipped with 4-stroke outboard motors (100 or 150 hp) was quantified. Experiments were conducted at three sites on the Illinois River near Havana, IL and most boat transits (57.9%) stimulated five or more fish to jump. The frequency of jumping (fish/min) w as independent of speed and motor type and the vast majority of fish (> 90.0%) jumped after the boat had passed their position but avoided the area directly astern (< 4.0 m). Furthermore, 79.8% of fish vectored away from the moving watercraft. The results suggest that jumping direction is not random and fish can localize the stimulus source. The “delayed” jumping until after the boat had transited the area indicates that the trigger may be turbulence and/or higher sound pressure levels. This is the first study to model silver carp jumping in response to motorized watercraft and can aid fisheries managers in predicting the direction and location of airborne fish to develop effective herding and capture methods."

The 1973 risk assessments were carried out by 70 + experts on 372 taxa (47 of the 51 species listed as invasive in the Global Invasive Species Database www.iucngisd.org/gisd/), which in decreasing order of importance belonged to the taxonomic Orders Cypriniformes, Perciformes, Siluriformes, Characiformes, Salmoniformes, Cyprinodontiformes, with the remaining ≈ 8% of taxa distributed across an additional 13 orders. The most widely-screened species (in decreasing importance) were: grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella, common carp Cyprinus carpio, rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva.

Severe hypoxia stress can lead to damage and even death of silver carp. Therefore, it is very important to explore how silver carp adapt to and respond to hypoxia stress. MicroRNAs play an important role in a series of important life activities in organisms. In this study, the differentiallyexpressed miRNAs were screened from a mixed pool of liver, brain, heart and gill of silver carp under different levels of hypoxia stress by high-throughput sequencing. Our findings provided new insights to further study the miRNA regulatory mechanism and molecular characteristics of anoxic response in silver carp. Hypoxia is one of the serious stresses in fish culture, which can lead to physical and morphological changes, and cause injury and even death to fish. Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) is an important economic fish and widely distributed in China. MicroRNA is a kind of endogenous non-coding single-stranded small RNA, which is involved in cell development, and immune response and gene expression regulation. In this study, silver carp were kept in the closed containers for hypoxia treatment by spontaneous oxygen consumption. The samples of heart, brain, liver and gill were collected, and the total RNAs extracted separately from the four tissues were mixed in equal amounts according to the concentration. Afterwards, the RNA pool was constructed for high-throughput sequencing, and based on the small RNA sequencing, the differentially expressed microRNAs were identified. Furthermore, their target gene prediction and enrichment analyses were carried out. The results showed that a total of 229 known miRNAs and 391 putative novel miRNAs were identified, which provided valuable resources for further study on the regulatory mechanism of miRNAs in silver carp under hypoxia stress. The authors verified 16 differentially expressed miRNAs by qRT-PCR, and the results were consistent with small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq). The predicted target genes number of differentially expressed miRNAs was 25,146. GO and KEGG functional enrichment analysis showed that these target genes were mainly involved in the adaption of hypoxia stress in silver carp through biological regulation, catalytic activity and apoptosis. This study provides references for further study of interaction between miRNAs and target genes, and the basic data for the response mechanism under hypoxia stress in silver carp."

This genetic map spans a length of 2,721.07 cM with 3,134 SNPs distributed on 24 linkage groups (LGs). Comparative genomic mapping presented a high level of syntenic relationship between silver carp and zebrafish.

All six QTL for growth traits of 12 mph generally overlapped with QTL for 6 mph, while the majority of QTL for 18 mph were identified on two additional LGs, which may reveal a different genetic modulation during early and late muscle growth stages. Four potential candidate genes were identified from the QTL regions by homology searching of marker sequences against zebrafish genome. Hepcidin, a potential candidate gene identified from a QTL interval on LG16, was significantly associated with growth traits in the analyses of both phenotype-SNP association and mRNA expression between small-size and large-size groups of silver carp.

Therefore, understanding their reproductive traits and particularly in the context of hybridization with other cyprinids was of value to explain their rapid propagation as well as potential benefits for aquaculture due to their unique diet, behavior, growth potential, and tolerance to deteriorating environmental conditions in freshwater ecosystems. Distant hybridization is an effective tool to create different ploidy offspring with changed phenotypes and genotypes. In this study, we reported distant hybridization of female koi carp (Cyprinus carpio haematopterus, KOC, 2n = 100) x male bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, BIC, 2n = 48) and the spontaneous occurrence of two new "crucian" carp-like homodiploid fish (2nGCC-L; 2nCCC-L; 2n = 100), a new type of triploid hybrid (3nKB, 3n = 124), and a new type of tetraploid hybrid (4nKB, 4n = 148). The body color of 2nGCC-L and 2nCCC-L were gray and multicolor, respectively. Both phenotypes were similar to the crucian carp (Carassius auratus).

Little is known about how Silver Carp function in these tributaries or how connectivity with a main-stem river can influence population demographics within either system. The Kansas River is a tributary to the Missouri River and has multiple physical anthropogenic barriers creating varying levels of connectivity within the system, as well as with the Missouri River. These varying levels of connectivity, or lack thereof, provide a unique opportunity to examine population demographics in river segments separated by barriers. We collected Silver Carp from upstream and downstream of the first two barriers on the Kansas River in the summers of 2018 and 2019. No Silver Carp were captured upstream of a hydropower dam at river kilometer 84 but were found upstream of a water diversion weir at river kilometer 24. Catch rates of adult Silver Carp were lower in the reach above the weir, but Silver Carp caught in this reach exhibited greater growth rates than Silver Carp captured below the weir. Catch rates of juveniles were also lower in the reach above the weir. Limited connectivity within the Kansas River via the water diversion weir could influence size structure and catch rates of Silver Carp captured above and below the weir. Lack of juveniles above the weir indicates that reproduction may be limited in this reach, and river conditions below the weir may be more suitable for rearing juvenile Silver Carp. This information is important for understanding Silver Carp population demographics across a range of river environments, providing critical information for the development and implementation of broadscale control plans."

Closely related predators often share similar characteristics (e.g., odors or body morphometry), and prey species capable of expressing generalized behavioral responses to predators with similar characteristics may increase their chances for survival. Here, we examined how naive juvenile silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), an invasive Asian carp, respond to three predator odors from predators commonly found in Midwestern lakes and rivers of the USA. We tested two congeneric species of bass (largemouth Micropterus salmoides and smallmouth M. dolomieu bass) and one outgroup, longnose gar (Lepisosteus osseus). Additionally, we tested how silver carp conditioned to recognize the odor of one group, largemouth bass, responded to the predator odors of the congeneric species and the outgroup. We found that juvenile silver carp showed no innate response to any of the three predator odors. Additionally, although they could be conditioned to recognize predator odors from largemouth bass, they were unable to generalize predator odors to smallmouth bass or longnose gar odor. These results suggest that invasive species could be less likely to persist in environments with diverse predator communities than environments of equal densities with uniform predator communities and that future studies should continue to explore this area as well as focus on understanding dynamics in predator-prey interactions of invasive species."

The level to which native piscivores are consuming this novel prey item is unclear. Therefore, the goal of this research was to assess the diets of native piscivores collected in Pool 26 and the Open River reach of the Mississippi River. Using diet contents and catch rates of small fishes, selection or avoidance could be determined for predator prey interactions. Then a controlled laboratory experiment was conducted to determine if common predators [White Bass Morone chrysops and Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede, 1802)] would select for or against this novel prey in the presence of two native prey fish [Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum (Lesueur, 1818) and Emerald Shiner Notropis atherinoides]. Understanding how predator-prey interactions occur in a controlled laboratory experiment may provide insight to trends observed in the field. The majority of native piscivores appeared to be avoiding Silver Carp in both reaches and selecting native prey fishes. The order in which prey fish were consumed by both predators showed significant avoidance of Silver Carp.

This study collected 410 samples of five wild freshwater fishes at different trophic levels from middle and eastern China. Concentrations of eight trace elements, chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) and stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were determined in dorsal muscle of fishes. Spatially, concentrations of trace elements were least in fishes from the Hai River Basin, while those in fishes from the Taihu Lake Basin were greatest The carnivorous topmouth culter and omnivorous common carp and crucian carp accumulated greater amounts of trace elements than did the planktivorous silver carp and bighead carp. Trophic biomagnification was for Cu, Fe and Zn, but not for Cr, Ni, As, Pb and Cd. Concentrations of As in 15 muscle samples (3.7%) from Taihu Lake Basin exceeded the guidelines (1.0 mg/kg, wet mass) provided by FAO/WHO (2014), while the total target hazard quotient (TTHQ) values were <1.0, indicating no obvious non-carcinogenic risks to humans that consume those fishes. However, people who consume larger amounts of fish products, or people who are vulnerable, such as pregnant women, children and people with poor health, might be at greater risk. Also, exposure to trace metals through other routes cannot be ignored. Accumulations of trace elements in Chinese freshwater fishes were affected by both geographical conditions and human activities.

However, the impacts of elevated temperature on fish reproduction are diverse in different regions. Previous studies have revealed that the spawning timing of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) in the Pearl River, in China, has changed over the past decade. However, few studies have explored the potential reasons, which are critical for determining fishing-moratorium periods and developing sustainable fisheries. The current study used discharge suitability index (DSI), temperature suitability index (TSI), correlation and time-series analyses to determine (i) the optimal discharge and temperature for silver carp spawning; (ii) relationships among the thermal regime, hydrological parameters, and spawning timing based on an 11-year time-series dataset. Our results indicated that the most suitable discharge and temperature for silver carp spawning were 13,000-15,000 m(3)/s and 25-26 degrees C, respectively. The start date of spawning fluctuated with a slight tendency to delay, while the spawning peak and end date obviously occurred earlier during the study period. Correlation analyses suggested that the increasing average temperature between January and March likely caused the initial spawning delay. Moreover, elevated temperatures in August and September probably promoted the anticipated end of silver carp spawning. However, increases in discharge did not significantly correlate with the start of spawning but were significantly and positively correlated with the spawning peak. These results indicated that elevated temperatures shorten the spawning period of silver carp in the Pearl River. Moreover, the initial spawning of silver carp seems to be triggered by temperature rather than changes in discharge; flow pulses can probably create more suitable spawning niches for H. molitrix. This study enhances our understanding of the effect of warming on fish reproduction in subtropical regions.</p>"	"10.3389/fmars.2021.708109"	"internal-pdf://0650242523/Xia-2021.pdf"

In this study, we focus on seasonal changes in one key attribute of a food web, the trophic level. We determine whether seasonal variations of fish trophic levels could be indicated by the change in food resources. Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (H. nobilis) were used to explore the responses of trophic levels of the filter-feeding fish to seasonal variations of food resources. Combined stable isotopic analysis and dietary analysis revealed that filter-feeding fish tended to have a higher trophic level in spring (May) and autumn (September and October). This may result from the abundant density of food resources (zooplankton and phytoplankton) and fish flexible foraging strategy, as we predicted that the trophic level follows the seasonality of food availability. Pearson’ correlation analysis and a structural equation model showed that seasonal variation of total phosphorus and water temperature could indirectly affect trophic levels of silver carp and bighead carp by mediating the abundance of phytoplankton and zooplankton directly and indirectly along the food chain. According to these findings, the seasonal variation of food resources could be an important indicator of the temporal dynamics of the food web trophic pattern in freshwater ecosystems."

The flow separation zone near the confluence of a river network is a favorite habitat and feeding place for silver carp, which is one of the four major species of Chinese carp and usually provides positive rheotaxis to water flow. In the current study, a series of laboratory experiments were done to determine the behavioral responses of juvenile silver carp to the hydrodynamic forces near the separation zone of a channel confluence. The locomotion and trajectory of juvenile silver carp were recorded by infrared thermal imaging, while the flow velocity field near the separation zone was measured by a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system. A total of 60 juvenile silver carp were released near the separation zone among which 40 carp swam in the upstream direction. Amongst them, 24 carp swam to the tributary and the remaining 16 swam into the main channel. Almost all these 24 carp travelled initially along the boundary of the separation zone near the corner, where flow shear was strongest, and then swam to the tributary. Instead of avoiding zones of strong vorticity, they chose and followed a trajectory along which the flow vorticity was large. On encountering these vortical flows, they increased the tail beat frequency and decreased the tail-beat amplitude to maintain body stability. These observations provide important knowledge on locomotion of fish near river confluences and are beneficial for the fish habitat protection.

To quantify the potential effects of AC on the food web in Lake Erie, we developed an Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) food web model and simulated four AC diet composition scenarios (high, low, and no detritus and low detritus with Walleye Sander vitreus and Yellow Perch Perca flavescens larvae) and two nutrient load scenarios (the 1999 baseline load and 2X the baseline [HP]). We quantified the uncertainty of the potential AC effects by coupling the EwE model with estimates of parameter uncertainty in AC production, consumption, and predator diets obtained using structured expert judgment. Our model projected mean +/- SD AC equilibrium biomass ranging from 52 +/- 34 to 104 +/- 75 kg/ha under the different scenarios. Relative to baseline simulations without AC, AC invasion under all detrital diet scenarios decreased the biomass of most fish and zooplankton groups. The effects of AC in the HP scenario were similar to those in the detrital diet scenarios except that the biomasses of most Walleye and Yellow Perch groups were greater under HP because these fishes were buffered from competition with AC by increased productivity at lower trophic levels. Asian carp predation on Walleye and Yellow Perch larvae caused biomass declines among all Walleye and Yellow Perch groups. Large food web impacts of AC occurred in only 2% of the simulations, where AC biomass exceeded 200 kg/ha, resulting in biomass declines of zooplankton and planktivorous fish near the levels observed in the Illinois River. Our findings suggest that AC would affect Lake Erie's food web by competing with other planktivorous fishes and by providing additional prey for piscivores. Our methods provide a novel approach for including uncertainty into forecasts of invasive species' impacts on aquatic food webs."

Silver carp (SC, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (BC, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) are intensively stocked in lakes and reservoirs in China and share similar food resources and trophic positions in water bodies. To better understand the ecological roles of SC and BC in natural freshwater, two mesotrophic reservoirs (Nanwan and Nianyushan) were selected to compare resource utilization and the trophic niche of these two fish species. Data analysis using Bayesian mixing model showed that SC was more like a fine particulate organic matter (fPOM) feeder, while BC consumed more coarse particulate organic matter (cPOM) and displayed a higher trophic position in both reservoirs. In contrast, niche breadths represented by the corrected standard ellipse area (SEA(C)) were essentially the same for SC and BC in Nanwan (SEA(C) = 6.1 for SC and BC), but much larger for silver carp in Nianyushan (SEA(C) for SC: 11.6, SEA(C) for BC: 4.2). The high stocking ratio of SC/BC in Nianyushan was the probable reason for the large SEA(C) of silver carp, which suggested that silver carp could use more food resources and become more competitive with a higher stocking biomass ratio. The results indicated that the trophic partitioning of filter feeders might be regulated by the stocking biomass ratio of the fish to some extent."

Twenty-six fungal strains with pathogenicity were isolated, and the challenge experiment showed that eight strains from Changji area had high infection rate to fish eggs. Based on internal transcribed spacer sequence data and molecular analysis, the 26 strains were classified into nine different species of six fungal genera. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all strains were divided into two clades, namely Cluster 1 (contains only the genus Mucor) and Cluster 2 (consists of five small branches), and the distribution of strains from the same region was scattered in two clusters. There is no strict host selectivity for these fungi to infect fish. Mucor sp. are the main fungal pathogen of fish in these four regions, whereas Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Carassius auratus are two types of fish that were susceptible to pathogen. In addition, the environmental adaptability experiments showed that eight highly pathogenic strains have different adaptability to the environment, and their optimum temperature and pH were 25 degrees C and 7.0, respectively, whereas the concentration of NaCl was negatively correlated with the growth of strains.

In this study, a high-resolution genetic linkage map was constructed by using 2976 SNP and 924 microsatellite markers in a F1 full-sib family of bighead carp, the length of which spanned 2022.34 cM with an average inter-marker distance of 0.52 cM. Comparative genomics revealed a high level of genomic synteny between bighead carp and zebrafish as well as grass carp. QTL fine mapping for sex trait was performed based on this linkage map of bighead carp and an unpublished linkage map of silver carp. A map distance of 3.863 cM (69.787–73.650 cM) on LG19 of bighead carp and 4.705 cM (79.096–83.801 cM) on LG21 of silver carp was significantly associated with sex phenotypes, and these two LGs are homologous between two fish species. Fourteen markers harboring in these regions were in strong linkage disequilibrium with the sex phenotype variance explained (PVE) varying from 89 to 100%. Two common markers were mapped on the QTL regions of bighead carp and silver carp, suggesting that these two carp species may have similar genetic bases for sex determination. Eleven potentially sex-related genes were identified within or near the sex QTL markers in two species.

Here, we present a chromosomal-level assembly of the species based on the PacBio Sequel II platform and Hi-C scaffolding technology. Based on the high-quality genome sequences and previous genome sequencing projects, a number of genes that were probably subject to positive selection reside in the genome of H. molitrix, and the last common ancestors of H. molitrix and H. nobilis were identified. Some of these genes may partially explain the mechanisms of H. molitrix for surviving damage due to toxic algae. Demographic history estimation suggests that the effective population size (EPS) of the species may have constantly increased along with the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, started to decline when quaternary glaciation started, and further declined during the Younger Dryas Period. Moreover, the introgression from H. nobilis to H. molitrix in North America was corroborated based on the whole-genome sequencing data, and the proportion of introgressed regions was estimated to be approximately 5.8%.

A total of 297 silver carp were sampled quarterly from the catches of gillnet fishermen, at six sites, between June 2019 and September 2020. Standard length of the specimens ranged from 130 to 585 mm, and body weight ranged from 45.5 to 3930 g. The length-weight relationship parameter b values reached 3.015. Age was determined through examination and measurements of fish scales, and the age composition of the sampled silver carp varied from 0+ to 4+. Fitting the new data to the von Bertalanffy growth model, we obtained an asymptotic size (L-infinity) of 1107 mm, k of 0.135, and t(0) of -0.666 for silver carp in this stretch of the river. The calculated growth performance index phi and estimated longevity t(max) were 5.22 and 21.56, respectively. The rates of total mortality, natural mortality, and fishing mortality were calculated as 0.4997, 0.1621, and 0.3377, respectively, while the exploitation ratio was evaluated as 0.6757. The overall results confirm overexploitation of this resource in the middle and lower reaches of the Pearl River. It was concluded that this species should be protected from capture until at least 790 mm in standard length, representing an optimal minimum size for capture to benefit conservation of the species and to sustainably develop this valuable fishery. The main objective of this study was to determine the age, growth, mortality, and population structure of the silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Valenciennes, 1844) in the middle and lower Pearl River. This work will benefit conservation of the species and to sustainably develop this valuable fishery."	"10.1051/limn/2021019"	"internal-pdf://2192779628/Zhu-2021.pdf"

Ichthyoplankton monitoring along the Illinois Waterway (IWW) has provided information on abundances of Asian carp eggs in the IWW's navigation pools. Post-fertilization times derived from egg development stages and water temperatures can be used to estimate spawning times of Asian carp eggs, but estimating how far these eggs have drifted requires information on river hydraulics. A Fluvial Egg Drift Simulator (FluEgg) program was designed to predict the drift of Asian carp eggs in the riverine environment with egg growth considered. This paper presents a reverse-time particle tracking (RTPT) algorithm for back-casting the spawning location of eggs from their collection site. The RTPT algorithm was implemented as a module in FluEgg. The new version of FluEgg was coupled with an unsteady hydrodynamic model of the IWW to predict the spawning locations for 530 eggs that were collected in June 2015. The results indicate that tailwater sections below the Locks and Dams (L&Ds) in each navigation pool appear to be preferred spawning locations for Silver Carp (a species of Asian carp). From the data analyzed, the most upstream spawning location for the June 2015 spawning period was in the upper Marseilles navigation pool, downstream of the Dresden Island L&D. The RTPT algorithm can efficiently estimate spawning locations for multiple egg samples."	"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.06.003"	"internal-pdf://3592454649/Zhu-2018.pdf"
