Due to persistent applications, BPA has become a potential threat to a variety of organisms including public health. In this study, a total of 80 bighead carps were randomly placed in different four groups (A-D). Fish in groups B, C, and D were exposed to BPA @500, 1000, and 1500 mu g/L, respectively for 60 days. Fish in group A served as an untreated control group. The body weight was significantly decreased while the absolute and relative weight of different visceral organs increased significantly (p < 0.05) in fish exposed to higher concentration (1500 mu g/L) of BPA. Results on proximate analysis showed significantly lower values of crude proteins, lipids, and moisture contents while increased contents of ash in muscles of treated fish. The erythrocyte counts, hemoglobin concentration, lymphocytes, and monocytes significantly decreased while total leukocyte and neutrophil counts significantly increased in treated fish. Results exhibited that different serum biochemistry parameters like serum albumin and total proteins decreased significantly (p < 0.05) while alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), urea, creatinine, glucose, cholesterol, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) increased significantly (p < 0.05) in treated fish. Histopathological ailments like pyknosis, degeneration of glomeruli, increased Bowman's space, ceroid formation in kidneys while ceroid formation, hemorrhages, pyknosis, karyorrhexis, karyolysis, nuclear hypertrophy, and eccentric nuclei were observed in the liver of treated fish. Histological observation of different sections of the brain of treated fish exhibited degeneration of neurons in the cerebellum, lipofuscin deposition, microgliosis, necrotic neurons, inflammatory cells, and hemorrhage. Results on light microscopic observation of different sections of the heart of bighead carp revealed necrosis, inflammatory reaction, neutrophilic myocarditis, and hemorrhages. In conclusion, it is suggested that BPA induces adverse effects on physical, blood-biochemical parameters, and histopathological changes in multiple visceral tissues of exposed fish."

Therefore, the current trial was conducted to determine the oxidative stress, status of different antioxidant enzymes and genotoxic potential of bisphenol A in fresh water fish at low concentrations. For this purpose, a total of 80 fresh water bighead carp (Aristicthys nobilis) received from commercial fish center were randomly divided and kept in four groups (A-D). Fish in groups (B-D) were exposed to different levels of BPA for a period of 60 days while fish of group A served as control group. Treated fish exhibited different physical and behavioral ailments in a time and treatment manners. Results showed significantly (p < 0.05) increased quantity of different oxidative stress biomarkers such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), reduced glutathione (GSH) and the contents of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in gills, liver, kidneys and brain of exposed fish. Concentration of different antioxidant enzymes like catalase, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase and total proteins was significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in gills, liver, kidneys and brain of exposed fish. Results showed significantly (p < 0.05) increased frequency of morphological alterations, nuclear changes in red blood cells and increased DNA damage potential of bisphenol A in gills, liver, kidneys and brain tissues. The current trial concludes that even at very low concentrations bisphenol A causes toxic effects via turbulences in physiological and biochemical parameters in multiple tissues of fish.

Previous studies suggest that suitable BHC habitat is limited to a few productive, nearshore areas. However, those studies did not consider the influence of BHC's diet plasticity or the presence of spatially-discrete subsurface prey resources. This study aimed to characterise Lake Michigan's suitability for BHC and evaluate the importance of these considerations in habitat suitability assessments. We used simulated outputs of prey biomass (phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detritus) and water temperature from a three-dimensional biophysical model of Lake Michigan to evaluate growth rate potential (GRP, quantitative index of habitat suitability) of adult BHC throughout the entire volume of the lake. Our GRP model applied a foraging model and a bioenergetics model to translate prey concentrations and water temperatures into habitat quality indexed by individual fish growth rate. We defined suitable habitat as habitats that can support GRP >= 0 g g(-1) day(-1). We developed six feeding scenarios to evaluate the impact of diet flexibility and subsurface prey resources on suitable habitat quantity. Scenarios were defined by the number of prey types the fish could consume and the depths at which they could feed (surface or whole water column). Consistent with previous studies, we found that habitats with the highest quality were concentrated near river mouths and in eutrophic areas of Green Bay. However, in contrast to previous studies, we found suitable offshore habitat for bighead carp owing to our added considerations of diet plasticity and subsurface prey resources. For silver carp, these considerations extended suitable habitat within Green Bay and in some tributary-influenced nearshore areas, but offshore areas remained predominantly unsuitable in all feeding scenarios. Differences in simulated habitat suitability between these two species probably reflect differences in energy density and mass of the specific fishes we used in our model. However, reports of these two species in environments where they coexist indicate that bighead carp grow at faster rates than silver carp, as our model simulated. Our vertical analysis at Muskegon, MI, U.S.A. indicates that subsurface temperature and prey biomass are not only sufficient to support bighead carp growth but provide maximum habitat quality during late summer stratification. Overall, our study demonstrates that BHC are capable of surviving and growing in much larger areas of Lake Michigan than predicted by previous studies, and thus suggests that the risk of establishment is not sufficiently reduced by low plankton concentrations. Maps generated by our model identified the potential for cross-lake migration corridors that may facilitate and accelerate lake-wide movements. We believe these maps could be used to prioritise surveillance protocols by identifying areas to which BHC might spread upon entering the lake. More broadly, this research demonstrates how the physiology and trophic ecology of BHC contributes to their high invasive capacity and can permit their survival in novel environments."

BigheadHypophthalmichthys nobilisand Silver CarpH. molitrix, collectively 'bigheaded carps' (BHC), are planktivorous fishes threatening to invade Lake Michigan. While previous studies indicate the lake contains habitat suitable for BHC growth, there is a need to understand how anthropogenic-driven changes to the abiotic and biotic environment could alter its vulnerability to BHC. We applied a spatially explicit model of BHC growth rate potential (GRP; g g(-1)d(-1)) to nine biophysical model scenarios to evaluate changes in habitat suitability in Lake Michigan. Scenarios differed in meteorology (cool, reference, warm), annual tributary phosphorus loads (0, 3300, and 5600 MTA), and the presence/absence of invasive dreissenid mussels. Mussel effects on BHC GRP relied on their contact with the surface mixed layer (SML), the depth of which was affected by meteorology. The warm year advanced the expansion of Bighead Carp habitat by increasing temperature-dependent foraging rates and lessening the time of competitive interaction with mussels due to earlier stratification separating mussels from the SML. Phosphorus loads were the most influential driver of the lake's suitability. Compared to present conditions, we estimate BHC could have grown an additional 8-40% annually in the 1980s when mussels were not in the lake and phosphorus loads were higher. Our study demonstrates how climate change and nutrient enrichment can increase Lake Michigan's vulnerability to BHC by affecting thermal regime and productivity, thereby limiting negative effects of dreissenid mussels on BHC growth."

To prevent their continued spread upstream toward the Great Lakes, intense commercial harvest was implemented on the Illinois River, a large tributary that connects the Mississippi River to Lake Michigan. Since implementation, harvest has reduced densities at the invasion front while also presenting an opportunity to generate a synthesis on ecosystem resilience in the face of accelerating invasion. Resilience, the ability of an ecosystem to recover after perturbation, was observed at local scales and within some taxa but has yet to manifest at a river-wide scale and often co-varied with abiotic environmental or seasonal factors. Thus, while intensive harvest has limited further spread of bigheaded carps, and evidence of additional secondary ecosystem benefits exists, opportunities remain to identify potential pathways that could spread such ecosystem benefits even farther."

We evaluated the potential consequences of a proposed barrier on the Illinois River Waterway, meant to inhibit the spread of silver and bighead carps, to the continued recovery of native fishes in the Des Plaines River following water quality improvements. We compared changes in upstream cumulative species richness and community structure from 1983 to 2013 in the DuPage River, an adjacent tributary with an impassable dam, to the area upstream of a newly proposed barrier on the Des Plaines River where fish can currently pass through a navigational lock. Fewer species displayed truncated distributions upstream of the passable lock and dam (n = 18) compared with the impassable dam (n = 23). Due to water quality improvements in the Illinois River as a whole, cumulative species richness downstream of both dams steadily increased over time. Richness also increased upstream of the passable dam but plateaued upstream of the impassable dam. Fifteen to 18 species accounted for differences in community structure between areas downstream and upstream of either dam. Most species (78-100%) were found in greater relative abundance downstream of the impassable dam, and only 53% were found in greater relative abundance downstream of the passable dam. The truncation in species richness and abundance at the impassable dam foreshadows the potential consequences of an indiscriminate barrier on native fishes and the continued recovery of native assemblages."

Consequently, microbes should not exhibit the kinds of biogeographic patterns seen in macroorganisms. This paradigm is challenged by a growing list of exotic microbes with biogeographic disjunctions that instead promotes microbial dispersal as inherently limited. We sampled water bodies in the United States and compiled records from the literature and public databases to characterize the distribution of the freshwater planktonic diatom, Discostella asterocostata (Xie, Lin, and Cai) Houk and Klee. Discostella asterocostata was thought to be restricted to the Far East, but we report its presence in ecologically similar water bodies across the eastern United States. Populations from the U.S. and China are indistinguishable morphometrically, suggesting they may be recently separated-a hypothesis supported by paleolimnological data, which support an introduction of D. asterocostata into the U.S. as recently as the mid-1980s. The overlapping distributions of D. asterocostata and invasive carp species, in both their native and nonnative ranges, highlighted Asian carp as a possible vector for introduction of the diatom in the U.S. The existence of exotic diatoms underscores natural constraints on microbial dispersal, resulting in biogeographic distributions that can be upended through human activity."

Fisheries"	"Increasing numbers of Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Bighead Carp H. nobilis (commonly called "bigheaded carp") in the Illinois River have led to concerns about the impact that their invasion has on native food web dynamics. Bigheaded Carp recruited in large numbers in the LaGrange Reach of the Illinois River during the summer of 2014. This provided an opportunity to determine whether native piscivorous fish prey upon invasive carp when they are abundant. Using electrofishing and fyke nets in the LaGrange Reach (August 1-November 8, 2014), we sampled native predatory fish (n = 1,472) for stomach content analysis. Fish community data from the Upper Mississippi River Restoration Program's Long-Term Resource Monitoring was used to quantify prey abundance (fish < 100 mm) in the study area and indicated that bigheaded carp represented 9% of available prey. Stomach content analysis revealed that the frequency of occurrence of juvenile bigheaded carp was greater than 15% in Shortnose Gar Lepisosteus platostomus, White Bass Morone chrysops, Black Crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus, Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus, Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu, Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, White Crappie Pomoxis annularis, Yellow Perch Perca flavescens, Flathead Catfish Pylodictis olivaris, Freshwater Drum Aplodinotus grunniens, and Yellow Bass Morone mississippiensis. Predators sampled in August and September foraged more heavily on juvenile bigheaded carp than those sampled in October and November. Electivity analysis suggested that juvenile bigheaded carp were selected over native forage by White Bass, Black Crappie, and Shortnose Gar, as these predators continued consuming them even as availability declined. Our results imply that native piscivores in the Illinois River consume and sometimes prefer juvenile bigheaded carp as prey. These results suggest that native predators might play a role in regulating bigheaded carp recruitment and that negative impacts to predators in areas of dense carp populations might be somewhat mitigated by the consumption of juvenile bigheaded carp."

Population abundance upstream of Lock and Dam (LD) 19 (LD19) on the upper Mississippi River (UMR) has likely been limited by the high-head dam at this location, which restricts all upstream fish passage to the lock chamber. We measured otolith (lapillus) stable isotope composition and elemental microchemistry of 146 Silver Carp (n = 77 females, 69 males) and 141 Bighead Carp (n = 76 females, 65 males) to determine early life environments (ELEs) of adult bigheaded carp captured upstream of LD19 at the invasion front, in an area of intense management (Pools 16-19). Otolith oxygen isotope ratios (delta O-18) and elemental ratios (Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca) were compared to values of isotope and elemental ratios in water from putative ELEs to assign the ELE for each fish. Most Bighead Carp (68.8%) and Silver Carp (54.1%) collected upstream of LD19 had otolith core signatures consistent with ELEs downstream of LD19. Nineteen percent of Bighead Carp and 34% of Silver Carp could not be classified. The sex ratios of bigheaded carp (Pools 17-19 combined) with otolith core signatures downstream of LD19 did not differ from 1:1. Our results, when compared to those of Whitledge et al. (2019), suggest low but stable recruitment above this population pinch-point dam in the UMR and suggest that targeting removal of bigheaded carp downstream of LD19 or inhibiting their movement upstream through the lock there might be effective as part of integrated control efforts."

Nonetheless, little data exists regarding their chronic toxicity to aquatic animals causing aquatic pollution. This study was designed to analyze the toxicological effect of different concentrations of CuO-NPs concentrations on the bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis). They were synthesized using co-precipitation method and characterized by X-Ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) and UV-visible spectroscopy that confirmed 32.84nm size, elemental composition and reduction level, respectively. The acute toxicity in terms of 96-h LC50 was determined using bighead carp as a model organism. After acute toxicity testing, DNA damage in blood peripheral erythrocytes of fish was observed by comet assay and oxidative stress in terms of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were evaluated after chronic exposure of different concentrations (1/3(rd) and 115(th) of 96-hLC(50)) of CuO-NPs in gills, liver, heart and muscle tissues of bighead carp. Samplings were conducted after exposure periods of 15, 30, and 45 days. The significantly higher damaged nuclei (%) and genetic damage index were observed in bighead carp after 1/3rd of exposure concentration than 1/5th of 96h LC50. Significant changes in enzyme activities and LPO level occurred regarding dose and time-dependent manner. The activity of SOD and GST increased for 30 days, followed by the decrease at both experimental doses. CAT activity significantly declined as exposure time was elevated, while the level of LPO also increased in various fish organs as compared to the control group.

Poor water quality in the upper Illinois Waterway may be a factor contributing to the stalling of the carp population front near river mile 278. In 2015, the U.S. Geological Survey collected 4 sets of water samples from two sites upstream and 4 sites downstream from river mile 278, and one tributary. Each sample was analyzed for up to 649 unique constituents of which 287 were detected including 96 pesticides, 62 pharmaceuticals, 39 wastewater indicator chemicals, 29 metals, 19 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), 6 disinfection by-products (DBPs), 5 hormones, and 5 carboxylic acids. Potential for bioactivity was estimated by comparing chemical concentrations to aquatic life or human health criteria and to in-vitro bioactivity screening results in the U.S Environmental Protection Agency ToxCast™ database. The resulting hazard quotients and exposure-activity ratios (EARs) are toxicity indexes that can be used to rank potential bioactivity of individual chemicals and chemical mixtures. This analysis indicates that several bioactive chemicals (BCs) including: carbendazim, 2,4-D, metolachlor, terbuthylazine, and acetochlor (pesticides); 1,4-dioxane (VOC); metformin, diphenhydramine, sulfamethoxazole, tramadol, fexofenadine, and the anti-depressants (pharmaceuticals); bisphenol A, 4-nonylphenol, galaxolide, 4-tert-octylphenol (wastewater indicator chemical); lead and boron (metals); and estrone (hormone) all occur in the upper Illinois Waterway at concentrations that produce elevated EARs values and may be adversely affecting carp reproduction and health. The clear differences in water quality upstream and downstream from river mile 278 with higher contaminant concentrations and potential bioactivity upstream could represent a barrier to carp range expansion."

For microbiological examinations, bigheaded carp gut contents and water column samples from Lake Balaton (Hungary) were collected from spring to autumn in 2013. Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene were performed to reveal the composition. According to the DGGE patterns, bacterial communities of water samples separated clearly from that of the intestines. Moreover, the bacterial communities in the foreguts and hindguts were also strikingly dissimilar. Based on pyrosequencing, both foregut and hindgut samples were predominated by the fermentative genus Cetobacterium (Fusobacteria). The presence of some phytoplankton taxa and the high relative abundance of cellulose-degrading bacteria in the guts suggest that intestinal microbes may have an important role in digesting algae and making them utilizable for bigheaded carps that lack cellulase enzyme. In turn, the complete absence of typical heterotrophic freshwater bacteria in all studied sections of the intestines indicated that bacterioplankton probably has a negligible role in the nutrition of bigheaded carps."

Changes in species dominance has been documented by a 25-year fish community dataset encompassing six reaches of the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. Specifically, common carp (Cyprinus carpio) abundance has declined across all reaches, whereas silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) have increased in abundance in the southern three reaches. To test whether signals in the data were consistent with regime transitions, changes in body-size patterns and trends in functional biomass and variance of functional biomass of the fish community were assessed. I further explored biomass thresholds relative to transitions. Shifts in body-size aggregations and trends in functional biomass support hypotheses that transitions from common carp dominance to a more functional diverse community represent alternate regimes. Results indicate such transitions occurred in the early 2000s for the two most northern reaches, and that the third most northern reach is nearing this transition. In the southern reaches, results indicate that transitions from common carp dominance to silver and bighead carp dominance also represent alternate regimes. Regime transitions support biomass thresholds between 8000 and 10,000 g per unit of day electrofishing effort of common carp and between 20 and 2000 g per unit effort in silver and bighead carp. Consistencies across reaches with similar dominance patterns provide support that reinforcing feedbacks, unique to the functional attributes of the dominant species, occur at similar biomass levels. Building knowledge of such feedback mechanisms is imperative to effectively manage for desired regimes."	"10.1007/s10530-020-02330-5"	"internal-pdf://3192293463/s10530-020-02330-5.pdf"

In floodplain-river ecosystems, there is growing interest from restoration practitioners in ecological resilience, yet regime shifts remain poorly understood in these ecosystems. To understand how regime shifts may apply to floodplain-river ecosystems, we synthesize our understanding of ecosystem dynamics using an alternate regimes conceptual framework. We present three plausible sets of alternate regimes relevant to natural resource management interests within the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois River. These alternate regimes include: 1) a clear water and abundant vegetation regime vs. a turbid water and sparse vegetation regime in lentic, off-channel areas, 2) a diverse native fish community regime vs. an invasive-dominated fish community regime, and 3) a regime characterized by a diverse and dynamic mosaic of floodplain vegetation types vs. one characterized as a persistent invasive wet meadow monoculture. For each set of potential alternate regimes, we review available literature to synthesize known or hypothesized feedback mechanisms that reinforce regimes, controlling variables that drive regime transitions, and current restoration pathways. Our conceptual models provide preliminary support for the existence of alternate regimes in floodplain-river ecosystems. Quantitatively testing hypotheses contained within the conceptual model are important next steps in evaluating the model. Ultimately, the synthesis and evaluation of alternate regimes can inform the utility of resilience concepts in restoration and management on the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois River and improve our understanding of ecosystem dynamics in other large, heavily managed floodplain-river ecosystems."

General resilience"	"Large floodplain-river ecosystems are often highly modified to provide services that society desires, yet these modifications can limit an ecosystem’s ability to adapt to changing conditions. The adaptive capacity of an ecosystem, its general resilience, is a conceptual framework for considering how a system will respond to such changes. We sought to apply aspects of three general resilience principles (diversity and redundancy, connectivity, and controlling variables) to our understanding of floodplain-river ecosystem structure and function. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach in a case study of the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS). In doing so, we developed ten indicators that highlight important structural and functional aspects of this floodplain-river ecosystem, and likely underlie the capacity of large rivers to cope with environmental change and disturbance. We developed diversity and redundancy indicators for aquatic habitats, patterns of floodplain inundation, and fish communities. Connectivity indicators included metrics of longitudinal and lateral connections. Controlling variable indicators included deviations from historic water surface elevation fluctuations, water clarity, nutrient concentrations, and aquatic invasive species. This set of indicators provides a simple description of the adaptive capacity of four distinct reaches of the UMRS: Upper Impounded, Lower Impounded, Unimpounded Reaches of the Upper Mississippi River and the entire Illinois River. High aquatic habitat diversity and redundancy, fish functional diversity and redundancy, and water clarity, and the scarcity of invasive fish species are all factors that likely contribute to the high general resilience of the Upper Impounded Reach. However, the limited longitudinal connectivity and establishment of a minimum water level for navigation are factors that may inhibit the general resilience of this reach. In the Lower Impounded Reach, there is high within-reach variability for individual indicators such as aquatic habitat diversity, fish functional diversity and redundancy, and longitudinal and lateral connectivity. In the Unimpounded Reach, a high degree of longitudinal connectivity likely enhances its general resilience, but low aquatic habitat diversity, low lateral connectivity, and relatively high number of invasive fish species inhibit general resilience. For the Illinois River Reach, the relatively high fish functional diversity and redundancy likely contributes to its general resilience, whereas high number of invasive fish species, low water clarity, low lateral connectivity, and high range of water levels may inhibit general resilience. Indicators derived from application of concepts of general resilience provide insight into the current coping capacity of the UMRS and identify opportunities for enhancing resilience."

To explore the efficacy of a consumer-based market (i.e., invasivorism) to manage them, we developed a conceptual model and evaluated three harvest approaches—direct contracted removal, volume-based incentives (“fisher-side” control), and set-quota harvest (“market-side” control). We quantified the efficacy of these approaches and potential population impact in the Illinois River. Contracted removal was effective for suppressing small populations at the edge of the range but cannot support a market. “Fisher-side” removals totaled 225,372 kg in one year. However, participation was low, perhaps due to reporting requirements for fishers. The “market-side”, set-quota approach removed >1.3 million kg of bigheaded carp in less than 6 months. Larger, older fish were disproportionately harvested, which may hinder the ability to suppress population growth. Total density declined in one river reach, and harvest may reduce upstream movement toward the invasion fronts. With sufficient market demand, harvest may control bigheaded carp. However, lack of processing infrastructure and supply chain bottlenecks could constrain harvest, particularly at low commodity prices. Given the geographical scale of this invasion and complicated harvest logistics, concerns about economic dependence on invasivorism that encourage stock enhancement are likely unmerited."

Understanding these dynamics is important when assessing the impacts of invasive species, such as bighead carp, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, and silver carp, H. molitrix, (bigheaded carp). These species have established throughout much of the Mississippi River Basin; however, Lock and Dam 19 (LD19) has slowed their establishment in the Upper Mississippi River, resulting in low-density populations with limited reproduction upstream. The age and growth of Bigheaded Carp in recently established populations, especially in this region, are poorly characterized. Therefore, we compared the age and growth of bigheaded carp for four low-density navigation pools of the Mississippi River near the invasion front with one long-established high-density population, separated by LD19. To assess growth rates and age at maturity, we estimated consensus age from pectoral spines, postcleithra, and vertebrae from 1229 bigheaded carp, 30 fish per 50 mm size class. Length at age of capture and back-calculated length-at-age were used to create growth curves using VBGC analysis. The analysis indicated higher growth rates of bighead carp and silver carp upstream of Lock and Dam 19 than downstream. Comparison of growth models with a likelihood ratio test indicated differences in length at time zero between the pools for bighead carp but not for silver carp. However, maximum length and growth rates were significantly different for silver carp upstream and downstream of the dam but not for bighead carp. These results will be used to better understand the population dynamics of this emerging population to inform control and containment actions."

Policymakers must decide how much to invest in mitigation or conservation policies, if at all, by understanding how invasions impact social welfare or social wellbeing. Estimates of social welfare implications, however, may be biased if important interactions between species and space are overly simplified or aggregated out of the model. In this analysis, a bioeconomic model that links an ecological model with an economic model of recreational fishing behavior is used to complete a comparative analysis of the social welfare implications across several different ecological specifications to demonstrate what biases exist if species interactions are neglected or if ecological characteristics are assumed to be homogenous across space. Results of the bigheaded carp case study suggest that social welfare losses from the invasion vary substantially if species interactions are excluded and vary less if space is treated homogeneously."

We conducted an experiment to assess whether fish herding using percussive sound or electrical stimuli can enhance catch rates and detection of bigheaded carp and other fishes in surface-to-bottom gill nets. Catch rates (fish net set(-1)) from traditional gill net sets where no herding method was applied were compared to sets combined with either sound stimuli (physical impacts to the boat hull and water surface to produce percussive sound) or electricity produced from a pulsed-DC electrofisher to manipulate fish movements. For most species, herding increased catch rates and detection probability compared to control sets. Sound stimuli increased catch rates of Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) by over three times, whereas electrical stimuli increased catch rates by over six times. Catch of Bighead Carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) was highest in nets paired with sound stimuli. Herding methods also reduced the number of samples required to attain target detection probabilities for bigheaded carp. Herding techniques combined with gill netting may be a valuable option for targeted bigheaded carp sampling, especially when electrofishing or netting alone is ineffective for these evasive fishes. Synergistic methods may provide a cost effective means of improving detection probabilities for bigheaded carp at their invasion front or other locations where densities are low and uncertainty of capture is high."

Recent technological advances in telemetry transmitters has increased the availability of tags sufficiently small enough to implant in juvenile carps. However, the effects of surgical implantation of telemetry tags on juvenile bigheaded carps have not been evaluated. We determined tag retention and survival associated with surgical implantation of acoustic telemetry tags into juvenile bighead carp (range 128-152 mm total length) at three temperatures (13, 18, and 23 degrees C). In addition, we assessed the effect of surgically implanted transmitters on the fitness, defined as changes in weight or critical swimming speed, of carp implanted with transmitters. Survival was high among tagged fish (85%) with 47% of tags retained at the conclusion of the 45-day study. No substantial decline in fitness of the fish was observed in tagged fish compared to untagged fish."

Family, genus, and species taxonomic-level random forests models were explored to assess the performance and accuracy of the predictor variables.

Egg membrane diameter was the most important predictive variable, but the addition of ten other variables resulted in a 98% success rate for identifying invasive carp eggs from 26 other upper Mississippi River basin species. Our results revealed that a combination of morphometric and environmental measurements can be used to identify invasive carp eggs. Similar machine learning approaches could be used to identify the eggs of other fishes. These results will help managers more easily and quickly assess invasive carp reproduction."

Spawning has occurred in the main-stem UMR but could be limited to high-discharge events when dam operations create a free-flowing river. Alternatively, naturally free-flowing tributaries could offer alternative habitat for successful reproduction. Our objectives were to examine temporal and spatial variation in adult gonad development, ichthyoplankton densities, and back-calculated spawn dates of invasive carp collected in three UMR tributaries. We compared ichthyoplankton densities between the upstream and mouth reaches of tributaries and densities between the UMR and adjacent tributaries. Ichthyoplankton samples were collected every 10 d, and adult invasive carp were sampled monthly at nine sites throughout the Des Moines, Skunk, Iowa, Cedar, and Mississippi rivers during April-October 2014 and 2015. Peaks in adult gonadosomatic index, an increase in postspawn females, and ichthyoplankton collections suggested that peak spawning occurred during late May through June, when water temperatures were 18-30 degrees C and channel velocities were at least 0.7 m/s. However, reproduction occurred as late as August in some tributaries. Ichthyoplankton densities were highest in the Des Moines River among tributaries, but tributary densities were similar to the UMR densities, suggesting that both tributaries and main-stem sites provide suitable spawning locations. Invasive carp reproduction in UMR tributaries provides additional sources of potential recruitment for further population expansion upstream in the UMR and should be considered when devising plans for controlling populations along the leading edge of the invasion."

Bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) are Asian cyprinids that have been widely introduced and are considered undesirable and detrimental invasive species in many parts of their introduced range. The relatively novel “Judas fish” technique is used to locate aggregations of fish in the wild by strategically releasing individuals equipped with surgically implanted transmitters. However, releasing Judas fish that are capable of reproducing is problematic because it could add to the invasion problem by contributing to recruitment if not recaptured. We thus tested whether surgical ligation and division of the ductus deferens could effectively sterilize adult diploid bighead and grass carp. If effective, surgical sterilization would result in a superior Judas fish by maintaining the reproductive motivation derived from intact gonads while blocking the reproductive potential. This technique was initially successful, but ultimately most individuals were able to recanalize the surgically-severed ducts and produce milt, and were thus potentially able to reproduce during the following spawning season. Thus, ligation and division of the ductus deferens does not seem to be a viable procedure to sterilize bighead carp or grass carp for deployment as Judas fish where long term sterility of the fish is paramount in importance."

Therefore, uncovering the genetic mechanisms underlying hypoxia adaptation and tolerance in fish prior to any genetic improvement is essential. Bighead carp is one of the most important freshwater fish species in aquaculture worldwide; however, this species does not have a strong ability to tolerate hypoxia. In this study, the dissolved oxygen level (0.6 mg/L) was maintained above the asphyxiation point of bighead carp for a long time to simulate hypoxia stress. The liver, gills, and heart were sampled before (0 h) and after (1 h, 2 h, 4 h) the hypoxia tests. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the liver were significantly (p < 0.05) elevated at 1 h after hypoxic stress. By observing tissue morphology, the cell structure of the liver and gill tissues was found to change to varying degrees before and after hypoxia stress. Transcriptome sequencing was performed on 36 samples of gill, liver, and heart at four time points, and a total of 293.55G of data was obtained. In the early phase (0−1 h), differentially expressed genes (DEGs, 807 genes upregulated, 654 genes downregulated) were mainly enriched in signal transduction, such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions and ECM-receptor interactions. In the middle phase (0−2 h), DEGs (1201 genes upregulated and 2036 genes downregulated) were mainly enriched in regulation and adaptation, such as the MAPK and FoxO signaling pathways. Finally, in the later phase (0-4 h), DEGs (3975 genes upregulated and 4412 genes downregulated) were mainly enriched in tolerance and apoptosis, such as the VEGF signaling pathway and apoptosis. The genes with the most remarkable upregulation at different time points in the three tissues had some similarities. Genetic differences in these genes may be responsible for the differences in hypoxia tolerance among individuals. Altogether, our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of hypoxia adaptation in fish. Further, the key regulatory genes identified provide genetic resources for breeding hypoxia-tolerant bighead carp species."

These species evolved in Asia, are now invasive in the Mississippi River, and feed voraciously on microparticles including plankton. The food habits and biology of these carps are broadly similar to many filter-feeding fish, none of whose chemical ecology has been examined. We conducted five experiments. First, we demonstrated that buccal-pharngeal pumping (BPP), a behavior in which fish pump water into their buccal cavities, is responsible for sampling food: BPP activity in both silver and bighead carps was low and increased nearly 25-fold after exposure to a filtrate of a planktonic food mixture (P < 0.01) and over 35-fold when planktonic food was added (P < 0.001). Next, we showed that of nine food filtrates, the one containing chemicals released by spirulina, a type of cyanobacterium, was the most potent planktonic component for both species. The potency of filtrates varied between species in ways that reflected their different chemical compositions. While L-amino acids could explain about half of the activity of food filtrate, other unknown chemical stimuli were also implicated. Finally, occlusion experiments showed the olfactory sense has a very important, but not exclusive, role in bigheaded carp feeding behaviors and this might be exploited in both their control and culture."

The objective of our mesocosm study was to investigate and contrast the roles of juvenile common and bighead carp in structuring planktonic invertebrate assemblages, with focus on rotifers. We examined whether predation by juvenile carp was indiscriminate or size-selective with respect to prey size. Furthermore, we examined how changes to large and small prey influenced the potential for compensatory increases of some taxa within prey assemblages. Both species of juvenile carp reduced large zooplankton taxa. However, rotifer responses were variable depending on the taxon and predator combination. Juvenile common carp enhanced abundance for Polyartha and Squatinella, but most taxa were unaffected. Juvenile bighead carp had a more varied effect on rotifer abundance, having no effect on most, reducing Keratella and enhancing Anuraeopsis. We also estimated net filtration volume of the zooplankton community for each of the treatments and found partial compensation in net filtration because of the increased abundance of a few rotifer taxa, but this reduction did not match the depletion of macrozooplankton. Rotifers that benefitted from the presence of fish predators likely responded positively because of reduced predation by mesopredators, because of their short generation times, and/or from reduced competition."

Ecological phenomena like biological invasions typically evoke notions of negative effects on native communities. Yet, negative effects within specific food-web components can also have positive feedbacks that manifest elsewhere within the food web. 
We designed an experiment to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of invasive bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis: Cyprinidae) on planktonic and benthic invertebrates and the growth and survival of juvenile bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus: Centrarchidae). 
Our experiment indicated that the presence of bighead carp indirectly facilitated bluegill growth and survival. The underlying processes driving predator-predator facilitation stemmed from a combination of indirect interactions occurring through invertebrates in planktonic and vegetated habitats. Individual bluegill consumed more cladocerans and predatory macroinvertebrates in the presence of bighead carp. The presence of bighead carp appears to have indirectly influenced interactions among cladocerans, invertebrate predators, and bluegill. 
Understanding the cumulative direct and indirect effects of bigheaded carp on aquatic ecosystems requires the documentation of both negative and positive effects. Although one taxon benefitted from the presence of an invader, our findings demonstrate that this response occurred because bigheaded carp caused imbalances within the food web. We urge that future studies consider a priori how positive and negative interspecific interactions shape the structure of food webs."

Environmental Sciences & Ecology"	"Bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) are an invasive planktivore that can greatly deplete planktonic resources. Due to the inefficient conversion of food into fish tissue, large portions of consumed materials are egested and shunted to benthic habitats. We explored how bighead carp alter pools of organic matter between planktonic and benthic habitats, and across ecosystem boundaries. Here, we report evidence from a manipulative experiment demonstrating that bighead carp greatly reapportion pools of organic matter from planktonic to benthic habitats to such a degree that additional effects propagated across ecological boundaries into terrestrial ecosystems. Strong direct consumption by bighead carp reduced filamentous algae, biomass and production of zooplankton, and production of a native planktivorous fish within planktonic habitats. Reduced herbivory indirectly increased phytoplankton (chlorophyll a). Direct consumption of organic matter by bighead carp supported high carp production and concomitant losses of materials due to egestion. Perhaps in response to organic matter subsidies provided by fish egestion, ponds having bighead carp had higher standing crop biomass of Chironomidae larvae, as well as cross-boundary fluxes of their adult life stage. In contrast, we detected reduced cross-boundary fluxes of adult Chaoboridae midges in ponds having bighead carp. Consideration of bighead carp as mediators of organic matter exchanges provides a clearer framework for predicting the direct and extended impacts of these invasive planktivores in freshwater ecosystems. The perception of bighead carp must evolve beyond competitors for planktonic resources, to mediators and processors of nutrients and energy within and across ecosystems."

Since their liberation, they have dispersed northward through the Mississippi River Basin and its tributaries. Although bigheaded carp are omnivorous filter-feeding planktivores, their predatory effects on zooplankton are of principal concern because many native fishes feed on planktonic invertebrates during some phase of their life history. The aim of our study was to quantify the magnitude of effect of bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) on zooplankton body size and daily secondary production across a range of body lengths. We conducted an experiment where we compared responses of zooplankton in the presence of a native fish assemblage (control, n=5 ponds) and a native fish assemblage plus bighead carp (invaded, n=5 ponds). The experiment lasted 3months (June-September, 2014) and was conducted in clay-lined ponds (0.04ha. wetted area; 1.5-1.75m water depths). We quantified the predatory effects of bighead carp on overall changes to the size structure of zooplankton assemblages, body lengths of zooplankton taxa and taxa-specific changes to standing crop biomass and daily secondary production. The size structure of zooplankton assemblage shifted towards smaller invertebrates in the presence of bighead carp. Bighead carp reduced the individual body sizes of Diaphanosoma (Sididae) (-19%) and Daphnia (Daphniidae) (-9%) after 3months. Moreover, the standing crop biomass (-92% to 98%) and daily production (-65% to 74%) of Diaphanosoma, Daphnia and Calanoida were reduced in the presence of bighead carp. Bighead carp reduced immature copepod nauplii by 75% when compared to controls and may have affected recruitment to the adult stage. Our experiment indicated that the magnitude of predation by bighead carp increased with zooplankton body size, although rotifers and nauplii were exceptions to this pattern. The combined effects of reduced body sizes of some taxa and direct predation on immature and adult life stages of larger taxa suggest that bighead carp may be affecting zooplankton demographics through additional mechanisms such as reduced egg production, mate limitation, and recruitment."

We present an optimization-based approach for prioritizing dam mitigations to restore habitat connectivity for native fish species, while limiting invasive species spread. Our methodology is tested with a case study involving 240 dams in the Upper Mississippi River, USA. We integrate six native migratory fish species distribution models, distributions of two invasive fishes, and estimated costs for dam removal and construction of fish passes. Varying budgets and post-mitigation fish passage rates are analyzed for two scenarios: ‘no invasives’ where non-selective mitigations (e.g., dam removal) are used irrespective of potential invasive species habitat gains and ‘invasives’ where a mixture of selective (e.g., lift-and-sort fish passage) and non-selective mitigations are deployed to limit invasive species range expansion. To achieve the same overall habitat connectivity gains, we find that prioritizations accounting for invasive species are 3 to 6 times more costly than those that do not. Habitat gains among native fish species were highly variable based on potential habitat overlap with invasive species and post-mitigation passabilities, ranging from 0.4–58.9% (‘invasives’) and 7.9–95.6% (‘no invasives’) for a $50M USD budget. Despite challenges associated with ongoing nonnative fish invasions, opportunities still exist to restore connectivity for native species as indicated by individual dams being frequently selected in both scenarios across varying passabilities and budgets, however increased restoration costs associated with invasive species control indicates the importance of limiting their further spread within the basin. Given tradeoffs in managing for native vs. invasive species in river systems worldwide, our approach demonstrates strategies for identifying a portfolio of candidate barriers that can be investigated further for their potential to enhance native fish habitat connectivity while concurrently limiting invasive species dispersal."

Additionally, differences in the behaviour of hybrids may lead to deleterious ecosystem effects that compound any negative impacts of the invading parental species. Invasive silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) provide an opportunity to evaluate how hybridisation may influence the behaviour, dispersal, and spread of an invasive species introgressive complex. In order to investigate the role hybrids may have in the invasion ecology of bigheaded carps, we examined the distribution, movements, and environmental cues for movement of two invasive fishes and their hybrids in the Illinois River (U.S.A.). Early generation hybrids (e.g. F-1,F-2, and first-generation backcross individuals) composed a greater proportion of the population at the invasion front where abundances of bigheaded carp were low. A greater proportion of early hybrids passed through dams upstream towards the invasion front than did other hybrids and parental species. The movements and environmental cues for movement of late-generation backcrosses (more genetically similar to parental genotype) were not different from the parental species with which they shared the most alleles. Although the direction of the relationship between movement and environment was sometimes different for the parental species and associated advanced generation hybrids, these results indicate that management for parental species will also affect most hybrids. Although early generation hybrids are rare, our results indicate they may disperse towards low-density population zones (i.e. invasion fronts) or are produced at greater frequency in low-density areas. These rare hybrids have the potential to produce a variety of unique genetic combinations that could result in more rapid adaptation of a non-native population to their invaded range potentially facilitating the establishment of invasive species."

Management of invasive bigheaded carps in the Illinois River has focused on using human-made barriers and harvest to limit dispersal towards the Laurentian Great Lakes. Acoustic telemetry data were used to parameterize multistate models to examine the spatial dynamics of bigheaded carps in the Illinois River to (1) evaluate the effects of existing dams on movement, (2) identify how individuals distribute among pools, and (3) gauge the effects of reductions in movement towards the invasion front. Multistate models estimated that movement was generally less likely among upper river pools (Starved Rock, Marseilles, and Dresden Island) than the lower river (La Grange and Peoria) which matched the pattern of gated versus wicket style dams. Simulations using estimated movement probabilities indicated that Bighead Carp accumulate in La Grange Pool while Silver Carp accumulate in Alton Pool. Fewer Bighead Carp reached the upper river compared to Silver Carp during simulations. Reducing upstream movement probabilities (e.g., reduced propagule pressure) by75% into any of the upper river pools could reduce upper river abundance with similar results regardless of location. Given bigheaded carp reproduction in the upper Illinois River is presently limited, reduced movement towards the invasion front coupled with removal of individuals reaching these areas could limit potential future dispersal towards the Great Lakes."

Swan Lake, a 1100-ha Illinois River (USA) backwater, was rehabilitated to restore ecosystem functions, but may provide valuable habitat for invasive bigheaded carps [bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (H.molitrix)]. Use (residency and passages) of Swan Lake by invasive bigheaded carps was monitored using acoustic telemetry (n=50 individuals/species) to evaluate the use of a large, restored habitat from 2004 to 2005. Passages (entrances/exits) by bigheaded carps were highest in winter, and residency was highest in the summer. Bighead carp backwater use was associated with the differences in temperature between the main channel and backwater, and passages primarily occurred between 18:00h and midnight. Silver carp backwater use was positively correlated with water level and main channel discharge, and fewer passages occurred between 12:00h and 18:00h than during any other time of day. Harvest occurring during summer or high main channel discharge could reduce backwater abundances while maintenance of low water levels could reduce overall backwater use. Conclusions from this study regarding the timing of bigheaded carps' use of backwater habitats are critical to integrated pest management plans to control invasive species.

Risk assessments based on habitat suitability can identify sites most vulnerable to invasion that should be prioritized for preventative actions. Since habitat suitability is the result of interactions between environmental and organismal attributes, analyses should incorporate individual variability in demographics expected in an invasive population. Individual-based models (IBMs) can predict habitat suitability by accounting for interactions between environmental conditions and individual-level variability. We developed an IBM to predict suitability of rivers in the northern United States to the invasive fishes silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (H. nobilis) and explored the projected effects of climate change on habitat suitability. All rivers supported adult survival, although complete survival of all adult demographics and positive growth only occurred in approximately 45% (17 of 38) of rivers for silver carp and 26% (10 of 38) of rivers for bighead carp. Only the largest individuals at the time of introduction survived in rivers where adult mortality occurred. Most rivers were unsuitable for young-of-year (89% and 92% of rivers for silver carp and bighead carp respectively). Climate change simulations had relatively little effect on adult habitat suitability but resulted in up to four times the number of rivers being suitable for young-of-year by the late-21st century and greatly extended the viable spawning season by up to an additional 65 days for silver carp and 77 days for bighead carp. Synthesis and applications. Our approach of using individual-based models as a risk assessment tool informs proactive conservation planning by identifying sites for invasive species early detection monitoring, promoting the development of contingency response plans and allowing for proactive prevention efforts. Model predictions also provide specific management guidance regarding the size and life stages to target for monitoring efforts, which capture gears to use, and the most effective time to sample for early detection monitoring."

Invasive species can have varying ecosystem effects and responses to control throughout an invaded range, and removal near invasion fronts may inadvertently alter these characteristics. Bigheaded carp (bighead carp (Hypophthabnichthys nobilis Richardson) and silver carp (H. molitrix Valenciennes)) are invasive fishes from Asia invading North American freshwater ecosystems. We used mobile hydroacoustic surveys to examine bigheaded carp population characteristics from 2012 to 2015 across an invasion gradient in the Illinois River (USA), one of the most likely pathways to the Laurentian Great Lakes. These bigheaded carp species comprised 23-46% of fish community abundance and 45-78% of fish biomass across reaches, with lower contribution near the invasion front where intensive management by harvest occurs. Bigheaded carp prevalence in the community did not differ by habitat and comprised > 50% of community abundance and biomass throughout the river for most size classes. We identified negative relationships between density and relative weight (an index of body condition) of bigheaded carp, suggesting evidence of potential density-dependent intraspecific competition. Efforts to reduce invasive species abundances near invasion fronts may reduce prevalence. However, this could inadvertently release individuals from density-dependent competition and could enhance reproductive potential, growth or movements. By employing a suite of control efforts, including continuous removal efforts (including novel approaches) and by limiting movements (e.g., utilizing roads, fences, dams), it may be possible to offset undesired consequences of increased condition."

Recruitment is oftentimes determined by conditions experienced during early life, and winter conditions become increasingly influential as species invade north in temperate regions. Bighead Carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and Silver Carp (H. molitrix) have invaded mid-latitudes of North America and threaten to invade farther north. We conducted pond experiments and bioenergetic simulations to: (1) assess the effects of mild winters on juvenile Bighead Carp and Silver Carp at mid-latitudes; (2) determine how conspecific density affects juveniles during mild winters; and, (3) determine effects of increased winter severity at increasing latitudes. Both species displayed high overwinter survival (85%) in pond experiments. Bighead Carp grew in length (mean 2mm) and maintained initial body mass and percent dry mass (index of energy content). Silver Carp maintained initial length and mass and remained in high condition (dry mass). Conspecific densities tested did not affect growth, condition, or survival. Simulations suggest juvenile Bighead Carp could energetically survive the longest, coldest winter simulated (48 degrees latitude); however, energy reserves at the start of winter became increasingly important for survival as latitude increased. Bighead Carp and Silver Carp recruitment success at mid-latitudes is likely driven by non-winter factors. If these species invade farther north, winter severity may play a stronger role in offspring survival, recruitment, and population dynamics. However, warmer and shorter winters at high latitudes caused by climate change will minimize this potential bottleneck and increase chances of successful recruitment."

Zoology"	"Invasive carps are ecologically and economically problematic fish species in many large river basins in the United States and pose a threat to aquatic ecosystems throughout much of North America. Four species of invasive carps: black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus), grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis), are particularly concerning for native ecosystems because they occupy and disrupt a variety of food and habitat niches. In response, natural resource agencies are developing integrated pest management (IPM) plans to mitigate invasive carps. Control tools are one key component within a successful IPM program and have been a focal point for development by governmental agencies and academic researchers. For example, behavioural deterrents and barriers that block migratory pathways could limit carps range expansion into new areas, while efficient removal methods could suppress established carp populations. However, control tools are sometimes limited in practice due to uncertainty with deployment, efficacy and availability. This review provides an overview of several emerging modelling approaches and control technologies that could inform and support future invasive carp IPM programs."

As a barrier, CO2 significantly reduced upstream movement but was not 100% effective at blocking fish passage. As a deterrent, we observed a significant shift away from areas of high CO2 relative to normal movement before and after injection. Carbon dioxide concentrations varied across the pond during injection and reached maximum concentrations of 74.5 +/- 1.9 mg .L-1 CO2; 29 532 -41 393 mu atm (1 atm = 101.325 kPa) at the site of injection during three independent trials.

This study used two-dimensional acoustic telemetry to assess the effectiveness of dissolved CO2 as a chemosensory deterrent to two carp species in a large U-shaped pond. Free-swimming movements of telemetered bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) were documented 24 h before treatment and 24 h during treatments at 60, 121 and 213 mg/L CO2 (mean concentrations in pond water). Several behavioral endpoints were then quantified and compared to evaluate deterrence efficacy. In general, results showed that both carp species responded similarly to CO2 treatments. Carps consistently relocated into areas away from the injection site and made fewer attempts to re-enter CO2 treated areas. On average, CO2 treatments reduced mid-line crosses between untreated and treated sides of the pond by 58% at 121 mg/L CO2 and 78% at 213 mg/L CO2 relative to normal swimming movements recorded before treatment. Fish swim speeds increased significantly when inside the CO2 plume during treatments during 213 mg/L CO2 trials relative to swim speeds outside the plume, possibly indicative of active searching and avoidance responses. Overall, this study found that CO2 altered the behavior of bighead carp and grass carp. Natural resource agencies could consider the CO2 concentrations identified in this study to inform future applications to deter invasive carps from locations where they are at-risk to move upstream.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is currently being developed and studied as a new piscicide option for nonselective population control. This study evaluated dry ice (solid state CO2) as a simple CO2 delivery method during winter piscicide applications. Nonnative Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Bighead Carp H. nobilis, and native Fathead Minnow Pimephales promelas were overwintered together in ice-covered ponds treated with 25kg dry ice/100,000L (low treatment) or 50kg dry ice/100,000L (high treatment). Overwinter fish survival was significantly reduced in ponds treated with dry ice relative to untreated control ponds. Fathead Minnows were less susceptible to CO2 exposure than the carps, with 26-96% survival in low-treatment ponds and 4-68% survival in high-treatment ponds. Silver Carp and Bighead Carp were more sensitive to CO2 treatments and no individuals of either species survived in ponds with the high-treatment level. Water samples were also collected in all ponds throughout this study, and we observed notably higher Silver Carp and Bighead Carp environmental DNA (eDNA) concentrations in dry-ice-treated ponds relative to untreated control ponds. Distinct changes in eDNA trends correlated with fish mortality, and results indicate that eDNA sampling could be a useful indicator of piscicide efficacy. This study demonstrates that CO2 administered as dry ice is an effective under-ice piscicide method."

Lethal efficacy varied across species with no Bighead Carp, Silver Carp, or Bigmouth Buffalo surviving the high CO2 treatment.

Little has stopped the spread as carp have the ability to pass through locks and dams, and they are currently approaching the Great Lakes. However, the location of the leading edge in the Illinois River has stalled for over a decade, even though there is no barrier preventing further advancement towards the Great Lakes. Defining why carp are not moving towards the Great Lakes is important for predicting why they might advance in the future. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that anthropogenic contaminants in the Illinois River may be playing a role in preventing further upstream movement of Bigheaded Carp. Ninety three livers were collected from carp at several locations between May and October of 2018. Liver samples were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in a targeted metabolite profiling approach. Livers from carp at the leading edge had differences in energy use and metabolism, and suppression of protective mechanisms relative to downstream fish; differences were consistent across time. This body of work provides evidence that water quality is linked to carp movement in the Illinois River. As water quality in this region continues to improve, consideration of this impact on carp spread is essential to protect the Great Lakes."

An investigation was carried out in six sites at (Itahara, S1), (Madhavgarh, S2), (Bakiya upstream, S3), (Bakiya downstream, S4), (Chakghat, S5) and (Panasaghat, S6) of the river to document the fish diversity, seasonal variability, and impact of environmental variables on fish species composition during the period 2017 to 2019. Altogether 75 fish species belonging to 54 genera, 23 families, and 10 orders were recorded. Fish species richness at (S1), (S2), (S3), (S4), (S5), and (S6) and was recorded as 9, 39, 38, 13, 61, and 49, respectively. Family Cyprinidae with 31 species contributing 41% was the most dominant family, followed by Bagridae (8%) and Schilbeidae (6.7%). Seasonal variation in fish species richness and diversity indices were observed in the river stretch. Maximum species richness (45) was observed at S5 during monsoon and a minimum (6) at S1 during post-monsoon. As per the International Union for Conservation of Nature categorization, 10 out of 75 fish species recorded from the river were considered to be threatened. Three exotic species, namely Cyprinus carpio, Oreochromis niloticus, and Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, were recorded at some stretches, which may be a concern for native fish diversity. Environmental variables like water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, water velocity, and alkalinity influenced the fish community structure. The selected (S1-S6) stretch of the river falls under the category of Slightly Impacted River based on the Shannon Index (H'>3). The present investigation was the first assessment of rich fish diversity covering the maximum stretch of river, which supports many important and small indigenous fishes for conservation."

The total water-spread area of the selected beels varied widely (8-50 ha), with 68.75% of the beels showing a reduction in water-spread area over the past 30 years. High levels of siltation and encroachment and detachment of marginal areas through the construction of roads were the major factors responsible for the reduction in the water-spread area of the beels. The reduction was observed to be in the range of over 33% in three beels (Raghunath Sora, Chulkani, and Dudua beel) to 83% in Bhoishpuri beel. In addition, one beel (Chulkani) experienced reduction in its deep pool area, which is an important wetland area that provides shelter to brood fishes during the dry season. Only 12.5% of the beels studied practiced enclosure (pen) culture for rearing fish. None practiced cage culture. Our study showed that only two beels (Bhoishpuri and Tariachora) were free from exotic fishes; the remaining surveyed beels reported exotic species such as, Cyprinus carpio (Common Carp), Ctenopharyngodon idella (Grass Carp), Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Silver Carp), H. nobilis (Bighead Carp) and Piaractus brachypomus (Pacu). The prevalence of exotic fishes in the majority of the beels (due both to escape from nearby aquaculture ponds during floods and intentional stocking in certain beels) would have adversely affected the diversity of indigenous fishes in those wetlands. From discussion with the fishers, 50% of the beels surveyed experienced a reduction in the number of fish species from that recorded 10-20 years ago. In addition to climate change-related factors (e.g. abnormal rains, floods, or drought-like situations), other factors - both natural (e.g. hyper-nutrification) and anthropogenic (e.g. construction of roads, houses, and other structures) - also adversely affected the studied wetlands. To help cope with these factors and increase the adaptive capacity of fishers, four measures aimed at mitigation are suggested. These are: the practice of enclosure aquaculture in beels; the construction of floating macrophyte refuges (katal); deep pool refuges; and stock enhancement programmes with climate-resilient indigenous fishes."

However, existing findings mostly demonstrate the effect of TDG on the tolerance of benthic fish in China. Few studies have attached great importance to investigating the impact of TDG supersaturation on pelagic fish. Furthermore, varied flow of flood can lead to varied TDG levels in the spill season. Fish resided in the downstream of high dams may experience a period of chronic exposure at a low TDG level before the arrival of flood peak. However, rare achievement has reported that the survival situation of fish exposed to TDG supersaturated water with a high level after receiving chronic exposure. This study investigates the tolerance of bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) (pelagic fish) to TDG supersaturation and determine the effect of a high level of TDG supersaturation on its survival after chronic TDG exposure. The results showed that TDG led to apparent abnormal behaviours and gas bubble disease signs in bighead carp. The tolerance of bighead carp declined with increasing TDG levels. Compared with the large juvenile bighead carp, the small juvenile bighead carp are more sensitive to TDG. Furthermore, the results indicated that bighead carp subjected to acute exposure after long term chronic exposure are more vulnerable to TDG. The data from this study may provide valuable information related to protecting aquatic organism diversity and establishing water quality standards related to TDG supersaturation. Abstract To assess the effect of TDG on the survival of different sizes of pelagic fish, bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) were subjected to TDG supersaturated water at levels of 125, 130, 135, and 140%. The results showed that apparent abnormal behaviours and symptoms of gas bubble disease (GBD) were observed in bighead carp. The survival probability of large and small juvenile bighead carp declined with increasing TDG levels. The median survival time (ST50) values of large juvenile bighead carp were 74.97 and 31.90 h at 130% and 140% TDG, respectively. While the ST50 of small fish were 22.40 and 6.72 h at the same TDG levels. In comparison to the large juvenile bighead carp, the small juvenile bighead carp showed weaker tolerance to TDG supersaturated water. Furthermore, acute lethality experiments after chronic exposure to TDG were initiated to further investigate the effect of TDG on bighead carp. The juveniles were first subjected to 115% TDG supersaturated water for 96 h. After chronic exposure, live fish were immediately transferred to TDG supersaturated water at levels of 125, 130, 135, and 140%. The results demonstrated that no fish died under chronic exposure and few fish exhibited slight GBD symptoms. The ST50 values for bighead carp subjected to acute exposure after chronic exposure were 61.23 and 23.50 h at 130 and 140%, respectively. Compared with the bighead carp subjected to acute exposure, bighead carp subjected to multiple exposures were more vulnerable to TDG."

High-intensity light has significant advantages over other behavior deterrents because it can be relatively inexpensive, easy to deploy and can be used in shallow waterways. Although previous studies have shown that light has the potential to guide and block the passage of fishes, the efficacy of light has also been found to be species- and situation-specific, and no study has yet examined how well light works for Bigheaded Carp. The present laboratory study sought to determine whether high-intensity white light might be effective at blocking Bighead Carp (H. nobilis) while having minimal effects on another model fish species. We measured the response of juvenile Bighead Carp and Largemouth Bass (Micropterus sahnoides) to three types of high-intensity white light (constant light [0 Hz] and strobing light [5 Hz or 12 Hz]) in both a dark [1 lux] and a dimly-lit [100 lux] laboratory flume. High-intensity light consistently blocked at least 74% of Bighead Carp in a dark flume, with strobing and constant light having equivalent effects (p > 0.05). In contrast, a constant light (80%) was more effective than a 5 Hz strobing light (33%) in a dimly-lit flume (p < 0.05). While Largemouth Bass were also blocked by constant light (63%) in a dark flume, both a 5 Hz (82%) and 12 Hz (88%) strobing light were more effective (p < 0.05). When tested in a dimly-lit flume, Largemouth Bass were not blocked by either the constant light or a 5 Hz strobing light (p > 0.05). Taken together, our experiments demonstrate that responses to light can be species- and situation-specific, and that high-intensity constant light has particular promise to block Bighead Carp in both dark and dimly-lit environments without strongly blocking bass. Light might be especially useful in shallow, clear waters that cannot be blocked by other means."

The possibility that sound projected into navigation locks might block this invasion is being considered and four types of complex sound have been shown to have promise: an outboard-motor sound, a proprietary cyclic sound, air curtains, and the (coupling) pairing of this proprietary sound with an air curtain. In a laboratory study, we systematically tested the effects of these stimuli on invasive bighead carp and common carp, as well as the native largemouth bass (which lack hearing specializations), in a darkened laboratory flume. We were specifically interested in whether the outboard-motor sound or the proprietary sound might be more effective at blocking and deterring fishes (i.e., does the type of complex sound matter), and whether coupling either of these sounds with an air curtain might enhance their effectiveness. We found that the proprietary sound was more effective than the outboard-motor sound at both deterring and blocking common carp as well as deterring bighead carp. The largemouth bass were less affected by both sounds. We also found that when an air curtain was coupled to either sound, the combined stimulus became more effective at blocking all three species. This was especially true for the proprietary sound which when coupled with an air curtain blocked 97% of bighead carp. The proprietary sound coupled with the air curtain has promise to block bigheaded carp and should be considered for field tests."

We compiled demographic data from 42,995 fish from 23 pools in the Illinois, Mississippi, and Ohio rivers, which universities and management agencies previously collected as part of management, monitoring, and research activities. We used this data set to test whether demographic rates (length-weight relations including body condition, mortality, growth curves, and female maturity curves) varied among subpopulations across a gradient of invasion status. We found that length-weight relations and growth curves varied among subpopulations, whereas maturity curves did not. Our findings demonstrated spatial variability in demographic rates for Bighead and Silver carp across a broad geographic area in relation to invasion status and river conditions.

These species vary seasonally in distribution and abundance due to environmental conditions such as precipitation and temperature. Monitoring this seasonal movement is important for management to control the population size and spread of the species. We examined if environmental DNA (eDNA) approaches could detect seasonal changes of these species. To do this, we developed a novel genetic marker that was able to both detect and differentiate bighead and silver carp DNA. We used the marker, combined with a novel occupancy model, to study the occurrence of bigheaded carps at 3 sites on the Wabash River over the course of a year. We studied the Wabash River because of concerns that carps may be able to use the system to invade the Great Lakes via a now closed (ca. 2017) connection at Eagle Marsh between the Wabash River's watershed and the Great Lakes' watershed. We found seasonal trends in the probability of detection and occupancy that varied across sites. These findings demonstrate that eDNA methods can detect seasonal changes in bigheaded carps densities and suggest that the amount of eDNA present changes seasonally. The site that was farthest upstream and had the lowest carp densities exhibited the strongest seasonal trends for both detection probabilities and sample occupancy probabilities. Furthermore, other observations suggest that carps seasonally leave this site, and we were able to detect this with our eDNA approach.

Here, we used nuclear microsatellites to analyze genetic diversity and structure and whole mitogenomic sequences to analyze the phylogeography of Silver Carp (SC; Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and Bighead Carp (BHC; H. nobilis) across their North American ranges. Our objectives were to assess: (1) the number of mitochondrial haplotypes that were introduced and how they are distributed in North America, which may provide insight into the history of the invasion, (2) how genetic diversity compares between the native Asian and introduced North American populations, (3) how genetic variation is structured across the North American ranges of SC and BHC as well as between the two species, and (4) whether patterns of genetic diversity and structure are likely to affect success of environmental DNA programs for monitoring these species. In both species, we found relatively few mitochondrial haplotypes, and most were present throughout the range. For both SC and BHC, unique haplotypes were found only in a portion of the species' range, possibly indicating the location of additional, more recent introductions. In both species, genetic diversity was moderately lower in North American populations (i.e., 75-90% of that found in Asian populations), but genetic diversity still remained high. We found very little population genetic structure, consistent with a rapidly spreading invasive species, and did not find evidence of cryptic interspecific hybrids. The markers developed for eDNA monitoring will be effective for detecting the majority of individuals of these species in North America. The relatively high level of genetic variation and lack of population structure of SC and BHC in North America indicate that genetic diversity likely will not limit their persistence and that high connectivity will likely complicate efforts to control these invasive species."

Despite the prevalence of this species culture it is considered invasive in North America and a threat to local fish communities. Investigations into the early life environmental requirements and optimization of intensive larval rearing have been limited. The present study attempts to establish most desired larval rearing conditions of bighead carp by investigating a novel static rearing method utilizing continuous light, salinity (2 parts per thousand; ppt), algal turbidity, and continuous food availability as compared to traditional recirculating culture system methods. Increased levels of salinity (3 and 5 ppt) were also examined in the novel rearing environment. A 2x2x3 full factorial ANOVA design was implemented to compare the main effects of larval rearing system, feeding regime, and stocking density (12.5, 25, and 50 fish L-1) and the interactions between the main effects on survival, biomass, length, weight, proportion of large fish (measure of heterogeneity), and specific growth rate over twenty days of feeding. A desirability function was then constructed to maximize survival (%), biomass (g L-1) and proportion of large fish to optimize larval rearing for diet nutritional requirement studies. Mortalities recorded in the experiment primarily occurred within the first ten days of feeding and leveled off during the second ten days of feeding. The desirability function identified the novel static rearing method, at high initial stocking density (50 fish L-1), and feeding with Artemia nauplii from inception as having the maximum desirability (0.733) for the selected variables. The predictions for biomass, survival and proportion of large fish from the desirability function were 2.38 g L-1 (95% CI, 2.14-2.62), 70.3% (95% CI, 60.1-80.6), and 0.768 (95% CI, 0.696-0.841) respectively. Elevated salinity, 3 and 5 ppt, was found to increase survival (51.3 +/- 3.5 and 64.3 +/- 10.1%, respectively) and proportion of large fish (0.76 +/- 0.08 and 0.82 +/- 0.02, respectively) i.e. decreased heterogeneity, as compared to 2 ppt (33 +/- 3% and 0.63 +/- 0.03) in the novel static rearing environment. This indicates that current results may further be improved if bighead carp are reared at higher salinities (3-5 ppt). The optimization methodology which was utilized in the current study could potentially be applied to any larval rearing program to select for treatments which meet specific desired outcomes."

During early ontogeny, the growth and survival of larval fish often depends on food availability. Because habitat and diet shifts are strongly tied to individual body size, factors that influence the growth rates of individuals (e.g. resource limitation, competition) also affect other aspects of ontogeny including the timing of habitat or diet shifts. In the context of biological invasions, non-native species can potentially disrupt the interaction of larval fish with their food via competition for shared prey, reducing growth and survival during a vulnerable period of an organism's life history. We hypothesised that invasive planktivores negatively affect native species through the vulnerable larval life stage via competition for zooplankton resources. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a series of experiments to assess and contrast the effects of invasive (bighead carp, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and native (golden shiners, Notemigonus crysoleucas) planktivores on zooplankton densities, and their effects on the growth, survival, abundance, and habitat use of larval bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus). Overall, the effects of the invasive planktivore were consistently greater than the native planktivore in terms of reduced prey densities, reduced bluegill growth rates, and delays to the timing of ontogenetic habitat shifts. Growth rates of bluegill larvae were reduced by 58-87% in the presence of bighead carp and 37% in the presence of golden shiners (relative to controls), but such reductions did not consistently lead to reduced survival (in mesocosm experiment) or relative abundance (in pond experiment). However, we estimated that bighead carp and golden shiners delayed ontogenetic habitat shifts in bluegill by 9-24 and 1-3 days, respectively. Although we did not detect an effect of planktivores on the numbers of larval bluegill, our findings suggest that bighead carp may still affect bluegill ontogeny and freshwater food webs by disrupting the timing of ontogenetic habitat shifts. By affecting the coupling of habitats via organism movements during early ontogeny, bighead carp may indirectly disrupt predator-prey interactions of native taxa."

We used fatty acids to evaluate potential effects of bigheaded carps on taxa from multiple trophic levels in the Upper Mississippi, Illinois, and St. Croix rivers. Seston fatty acid concentrations were highest in the Illinois River lotic sites and connected backwaters and were positively associated with omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids, indicating that these locations had abundant, high-quality basal food resources despite hosting the greatest bigheaded carp densities. Fatty acid profiles of threeridge freshwater mussels tracked the fatty acid values in the seston and were not influenced by bigheaded carp abundances. Hydropsychid caddisflies and bluegill did not differ significantly in total fatty acids or percent lipid among spatial locations, indicating that omnivorous species may be relatively unaffected by bigheaded carps. Gizzard shad, however, exhibited the lowest fatty acid concentrations in the locations with the highest relative bigheaded carp densities, and multivariate models identified bigheaded carp densities as the predictive factor that explained the greatest amount of variability. Zooplankton abundance has been greatly reduced after bigheaded carps' establishment in the Illinois River, which may explain the disconnect between the gizzard shad fatty acids and the plentiful, high-quality phytoplankton in that river. Our data provide additional evidence that bigheaded carps are negatively affecting native planktivores such as gizzard shad."

Unfortunately, sorting and identifying ichthyoplankton to monitor for bigheaded carp reproduction is time consuming and expensive. Traditional methods require frequent egg-larvae sampling, sorting of all samples to obtain presumptively identified bigheaded carp, and genetic validation of presumptively identified eggs. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) has the potential to streamline this process by identifying samples that likely do or do not contain a target species. Our objective was to develop a genetic screening tool using qPCR with the duplex assays SCTM4/5 and BHTM1/2 to prioritize samples that have a higher likelihood of containing bigheaded carp eggs or larvae. We used tandem ichthyoplankton samples collected for monitoring bigheaded carps in the Upper Mississippi, Illinois, and St. Croix rivers to evaluate the effectiveness of qPCR as a screening tool. Samples with >10,000 copies of DNA had 100% occurrence of bigheaded carp eggs or larvae in the traditionally sorted samples, whereas samples with <10 copies of DNA had 0% occurrence of ichthyoplankton from these invasive species. We used a logistic regression model to calculate the probability of finding bigheaded carp eggs or larvae based upon the number of DNA copies; 406 copies corresponded with a 50% probability of having bigheaded carp ichthyoplankton present in a sample. These data can be used to inform management actions (i.e., control, containment) for these invasive fishes, and this tool could be adapted for monitoring for reproduction of other aquatic invasive species."

Mississippi River Lock and Dam 19 is a high-head dam that represents a population 'pinch-point' as passage through the lock chamber is the only means by which fishes can complete upstream movement. As such, this location could be a pivotal control point for minimizing the spread of invasive fishes in the Upper Mississippi River and a possible candidate site for installation of deterrent measures. Our objectives were (1) to study the timing (i.e., weekly and diel) and behavior of fishes in the downstream lock approach, (2) evaluate the relation of presence in the downstream lock approach with environmental factors and lock operation, and (3) identify any upstream or downstream passage events through the lock chamber and the relation between these events and the operation of the lock. Acoustic transmitters were surgically implanted into 262 Asian carps and 216 native fishes to monitor fish activity on a telemetry receiver array deployed around and within the lock for 622 days during 2017-2018. One hundred eighty-six telemetered fish were detected in the downstream lock approach. We documented 14 upstream Asian carp passages and 10 upstream native fish passages; these passages coincided with a specific sequence of large vessel lockages. The results of this study advance our understanding of fish presence and behavior at a Mississippi River mainstem lock and dam and inform the development and testing of deterrent systems at this location or at similar pinch-point lock and dams."

It was found that the order of MCs accumulation in different tissues and organs of bighead carp was ranged from high to low as: muscle>hepatopancreas>serum, the accumulation of MCs very significantly higher in muscle and hepatopancreas than that in serum (P< 0.01), and without significant difference among muscle, hepatopancreas and serum in different areas (P>0.05). In different month, however, there was significant difference in MCs accumulation among muscle, hepatopancreas and serum( P<0.01). The accumulation of MCs in muscle, hepatopancreas and serum was very significantly influenced by water temperature and the MCs level in the algae in water(P<0.01),body length showing very significant impacting on the accumulation of MCs in hepatopancreas and serum(P<0.01). The higher level of MCs in bighead carp was observed during the outbreak of cyanobacteria. According to the recommended daily intakes of MC-LR from WHO,the daily intake of 229. 62-977.20 g for bighead carp in the four areas is suggested without human health risk. The findings provide reference with assessment of accumulation of MCs in bighead carp and food safety."	""	""

This agent-based model and analysis explore bighead carp behavior in response to acoustic deterrence in an effort to discover properties that increase likelihood of deterrence system failure. Results indicate the most significant (p < 0.05) influences on barrier failure are the quantity of detritus and plankton behind the barrier, total number of bighead carp successfully deterred by the barrier, and number of native fishes freely moving throughout the simulation. Quantity of resources behind the barrier influence bighead carp to penetrate when populations are resource deprived. When native fish populations are low, an accumulation of phytoplankton can occur, increasing the likelihood of an algal bloom occurrence.

Fisheries"	"Invasive Asian carp established in the United States spawn in the turbulent water of rivers, and their eggs and early larvae develop while drifting in the current. The eggs, which are believed to perish if they settle before hatching, are slightly denser than water and are held in suspension by water turbulence. It is possible to use egg drift modeling to assess the capability of a river to support the survival of Asian carp eggs. Detection of spawning and estimation of egg abundance in the drift are typically assessed by ichthyoplankton trawls. Correct sampling design and interpretation of trawl data require knowledge of the vertical distribution of eggs in the drift, which can be accomplished with particle transport models. Data that are required to populate models of egg drift and vertical distribution include physical properties of assessed rivers and information on egg size, density, and terminal fall velocity, but data on these egg characteristics have not been previously available. Physical characteristics of the eggs are presented as a function of postfertilization time. We recorded mean egg diameter and terminal fall velocity for eggs from each Asian carp species during the first 5 h of development and at approximately 12 and 22 h postfertilization. Eggs of all species reached their maximum size before 4 h. Water-hardened eggs of Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Grass Carp Ctenopharyngodon idella were similarly sized in our trials, and water-hardened eggs of Bighead Carp H. nobilis were the largest. After water hardening, Silver Carp eggs sank slowest, and Bighead Carp eggs sank fastest. For a given species, smaller-diameter eggs generally had faster terminal fall velocities and higher specific gravity than larger eggs. We provide regression models of egg density and diameter for all three species, discuss usage of these data in modeling the drift and dispersion of Asian carp eggs, and discuss implications for egg sampling design."

Questions about recruitment potential motivate a need for accurate models of egg and larval dispersal. Quantitative data on swimming behaviors and capabilities during early ontogeny are needed to improve these dispersal models. We measured ontogenetic changes in routine and maximum swimming speeds of bighead, grass, and silver carp larvae. Daily measurements of routine swimming speed were taken for two weeks post-hatch using a still camera and the LARVEL program, a custom image-analysis software. Larval swimming speed was calculated using larval locations in subsequent image frames and time between images. Using an endurance chamber, we determined the maximum swimming speed of larvae (post-gas bladder inflation) for four to eight weeks post-hatch. For all species, larval swimming speeds showed similar trends with respect to ontogeny: increases in maximum speed, and decreases in routine speed. Maximum speeds of bighead and grass carp larvae were similar and generally faster than silver carp larvae. Routine swimming speeds of all larvae were highest before gas bladder inflation, most likely because gas bladder inflation allowed the fish to maintain position without swimming. Downward vertical velocities of pre-gas bladder inflation fish were faster than upward velocities. Among the three species, grass carp larvae had the highest swimming speeds in the pre-gas bladder inflation period, and the lowest speeds in the post-gas bladder inflation period. Knowledge of swimming capability of these species, along with hydraulic characteristics of a river, enables further refinement of models of embryonic and larval drift."

Fish and other aquatic foods (blue foods) present an opportunity for more sustainable diets(1,2). Yet comprehensive comparison has been limited due to sparse inclusion of blue foods in environmental impact studies(3,4) relative to the vast diversity of production(5). Here we provide standardized estimates of greenhouse gas, nitrogen, phosphorus, freshwater and land stressors for species groups covering nearly three quarters of global production. We find that across all blue foods, farmed bivalves and seaweeds generate the lowest stressors. Capture fisheries predominantly generate greenhouse gas emissions, with small pelagic fishes generating lower emissions than all fed aquaculture, but flatfish and crustaceans generating the highest. Among farmed finfish and crustaceans, silver and bighead carps have the lowest greenhouse gas, nitrogen and phosphorus emissions, but highest water use, while farmed salmon and trout use the least land and water. Finally, we model intervention scenarios and find improving feed conversion ratios reduces stressors across all fed groups, increasing fish yield reduces land and water use by up to half, and optimizing gears reduces capture fishery emissions by more than half for some groups. Collectively, our analysis identifies high-performing blue foods, highlights opportunities to improve environmental performance, advances data-poor environmental assessments, and informs sustainable diets."

In the Illinois River, an important tributary of the Upper Mississippi River, reproduction appears to be sporadic and frequently unsuccessful, yet bigheaded carp densities in this river are among the highest recorded on the continent. Understanding the causative factors behind erratic recruitment in this commercially-harvested invasive species is important for both limiting their spread and managing their harvest. We analyzed weekly catch records from 15 years of a standardized monitoring program to document the emergence of age-0 bigheaded carp in relation to environmental conditions. The appearance of age-0 fish was generally linked to hydrographic attributes, which probably serve as a cue for spawning. However, we found profound differences in the number of age-0 fish among years, which varied by as much as five orders of magnitude in successive years. The strong link between summer flooding and age-0 fish production we observed emphasizes the importance of understanding the hydrologic context in which sustained invasions occur. Despite evidence of sporadic recruitment, bigheaded carp populations in the Illinois River appear to be consistent or increasing because of particularly strong, episodic year classes."

To explore how navigational Lock and Dams (LDs) on the Mississippi River could be used to deter the upstream migration of invasive fish species, computer modelling that combined computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and agent-based (AB) fish passage model (CFD-AB model) could be used to hypothetically quantify the passage of bigheaded carp (Hypophthalmichthys spp.) through LDs. Agent-based fish (AB-fish) are always located on a node of the CFD mesh and move by selecting the neighboring node that minimizes fatigue. A possible limitation of this approach is that the AB-fish movement exhibits a dependence upon the CFD mesh. The proposed modified approach allows the AB-fish to occupy any point in the computational domain and to continually (within the size of the time step) update their minimum fatigue path. Computations in a simplified channel/dam structure show that the modified CFD-AB results are smoother swimming trajectories and increased estimates of fish passage when compared to the original CFD-AB model."

Fisheries"	"Three species of invasive carp-Grass Carp Ctenopharyngodon idella, Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, and Bighead Carp H. nobilis-are rapidly spreading throughout North America. Monitoring their reproduction can help to determine establishment in new areas but is difficult due to challenges associated with identifying fish eggs. Recently, random forest models provided accurate identification of eggs based on morphological traits, but the models have not been validated using independent data. Our objective was to evaluate the predictive performance of egg identification models developed by Camacho et al. (2019) for classifying invasive carp eggs by using an independent data set. When invasive carp were grouped as one category, predictive accuracy was high at the following levels: family (89%), genus (90%), species (91%), and species with reduced predictor variables (94%). Invasive carp predictive accuracy decreased when we only considered observations from newly sampled locations (family: 9%; genus: 22%; species: 30%; species with reduced predictor variables: 70%), suggesting potential differences in egg characteristics among locations. Random forest models using a combination of previous and new data resulted in high predictive accuracy for invasive carp (96-98%) when invasive carp were grouped as one class for all models at the family, genus, and species levels. The two most influential predictor variables were average membrane diameter and average embryo diameter; the probability of predicting an invasive carp egg increased with these metrics. High predictive accuracy metrics suggest that these trained and validated random forest models can be used to identify invasive carp eggs based on morphometric variables. However, decreased performance at new locations suggests that more research would be beneficial to determine the models' applicability to a larger spatial region."

The flow regime alternation of rivers has an impact on the spawning and reproduction conditions of four major Chinese carps in the lower reaches of the Three Gorges Reservoir. To investigate the changes in hydrological conditions and spawning and reproduction performances of four major Chinese carps during their spawning period before and after impoundment of Three Gorges Reservoir, a quantitative analysis of the relevance between such hydrological parameters as flow, water level, sediment concentration and water temperature of Yichang Station and larva runoff of the four species during their spawning period was carried out. As suggested by the results, when four major Chinese carps are spawning, the proper hydrological parameters would be 11,000-15,000 m(3)/s for flow, 43.0-46.0 m for water level, 0.01-0.21 kg/m(3) for sediment concentration and 4-8 d for water rise, and 22-24 degrees C for water temperature. Among those values, water rise and sediment concentration appear to be in significant positive correlation with the larvae abundance of four major Chinese carps, and thus remain critical factors. After the impoundment of Three Gorges Reservoir, the declining trend in flow, water level and water temperature during the spawning period of four major Chinese carps is not significant when compared with that in sediment concentration (by over 98%). The spawning and reproduction time of four species also gets retarded due to the late-coming proper water temperature, so does the spawning scale. The proportions of four carps also change a lot, with silver carp ascending to be at the highest ratio among them. This study can provide a reference for the protection of important fishes in the lower reaches of Three Gorges Reservoir."

Of particular concern are invasive planktivorous fishes (e.g., silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and bighead carp H. nobilis, collectively known as bigheaded carps) that have the potential to modify basal food web structure and compete for planktonic resources with native planktivores and young-of-year fishes. Bigheaded carps have proliferated throughout the Mississippi River basin, creating an outsized potential for resource competition with native fishes. Studies have showed niche overlap between bigheaded carps and native planktivores is generally high but that overlap varies among rivers. Importantly, niche overlap has not been assessed for density extremes of bigheaded carps within a river to determine whether trophic niches changed as a result of the invasion. The objectives of this study were to determine whether (1) silver and/or bighead carps share a similar isotopic niche with four native planktivores, and (2) that association varies ecologically (i.e., low- and high-densities of bigheaded carps) and spatially (i.e., between rivers). Our results generally show high trophic overlap among species, suggesting potential direct resource competition. Niche overlap was higher in study reaches with low densities of bigheaded carps compared to reaches with high densities, presumably due to intense resource competition and limiting of resources under high densities of bigheaded carps. Across density extremes, trophic reorganization by bigmouth buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus) was divergent from other native planktivores. Species-specific responses may be due to subtle differences in feeding strategies, degree of planktivory, food selectivity, and correlated food size distributions."

This manuscript describes the adaptive development (2013–2017) and results of an early detection and monitoring (EDM) program for non-indigenous fishes in lower Green Bay and the Fox River, a high-risk location for species introductions in Lake Michigan and a potential vector between the Great Lakes and inland ecosystems. The adaptive management approach to EDM has been a continuous cycle of refining sampling gears and methods to improve monitoring each successive year and determining a new method to assess survey performance (determining the contemporary fish community). To date, no non-indigenous fishes previously unknown to the Great Lakes have been detected. Survey performance (i.e., ability to capture species in the fish communty) of this EDM program has increased since its inception in 2013, and a target of 90% survey performance was achieved or nearly met in 2014–2017. Gears and methods will continue to be adaptively refined; however, the current sampling regime and survey performance should provide effective early detection of new non-indigenous fishes, allowing managers to respond early in the introduction phase, when management actions may be more effective."

A choice experiment by which CO2 was injected into channels of an annular flowing water flume was completed. In trials when CO2 was injected into the inner vein, fish spent less time in the vein when compared with control conditions.

Preliminary assessments of spawning potential of Great Lakes tributaries are needed to effectively allocate resources to early-detection programs and more detailed hydrodynamic modelling. Previous preliminary assessments determining the Asian carp spawning potential of tributaries potentially masked temporal variations in stream temperature and velocity. A preliminary assessment was developed that incorporates both the spawning biology of Asian carps and the hydrodynamics of tributaries, based on data at a higher temporal resolution than used previously, to determine the spawning potential of a tributary. The assessment was conducted on eight Lake Ontario tributaries, based on in-situ temperature and velocity data from 2009 to 2014. Two tributaries were found to be suitable using mean data across the assessed time frame; however, inter-annual suitability varied greatly and six tributaries were found to be suitable in at least one of six years over the study period. The assessment highlights previously unexplored inter-annual variation in suitability and provides a method using existing data to identify suitable tributaries for more detailed analyses involving hydrodynamic modelling. This approach can be used as a heuristic first step to inform management actions, such as early-detection and rapid-response programs, to prevent Asian carp spawning in the Canadian Great Lakes basin.

Hydrodynamic modelling can determine if successful hatching of carp eggs can occur in a tributary, by predicting egg movement during a spawning event to see if hatching can occur before eggs settle. A 3-D hydrodynamic model, coupled with a Lagrangian particle tracker, was used to assess hatching rates of three Asian carp species (bighead, grass, and silver carps) in different temperature and flow scenarios in the east Don River, a potential spawning tributary to Lake Ontario. In-river hatching rates were highest in scenarios with warmer summer water temperatures (23-25 degrees C) and flow magnitudes of 15-35 m(3)/s, which occur at least once every year. Using a 3-D hydrodynamic model allowed the inclusion of low-velocity zones where eggs become trapped in lower flow scenarios, thereby reducing modelled hatching success. In-river hatching rates were significantly reduced when the spawning location was moved close to the mouth of the river, with no modelled hatching if spawning occurred in the lower 8 km of the Don River, indicating that preventing Asian carp movement upstream would viably reduce the chances of successfully spawning occurring in this tributary.

Our objectives were to quantify patterns and habitat associations of adult bigheaded carp reproduction, larval production, and habitat use; such information is important for control strategies and identifying recruitment sources. During May-August 2011, we sampled adults and larvae at 10 sites distributed adjacent to and within the main channel of the Mississippi River at Pool 26 (study area = 28 river kilometers). Female reproductive status, adult location, and larval density were compared to environmental conditions, including temperature, site velocity, and turbidity. Large females spawned earlier than their smaller counterparts. No clear spawning aggregations of adults were observed, suggesting plasticity in staging habitat. Larvae were distributed across all sites during flooding. Larval density was positively related to velocity and turbidity, suggesting that nondepositional areas may facilitate recruitment. Bigheaded carp larvae comprised 10% of the ichthyofauna. Although pooled reaches are a source of recruitment for bigheaded carp in the Mississippi River system, the low densities of bigheaded carp larvae relative to native larvae cannot explain the dominance of adults in this system. Our findings provide insights into the plastic nature of bigheaded carp reproduction and habitats associated with larval development. Control efforts that target large adult females should be conducted earlier during the spring spawn. To maintain fishing pressure, such control efforts would likely need to continue through the summer, when smaller individuals spawn, discharge decreases, and CPUE increases. However, we found no specific mass staging area or habitat type where adult females could be targeted."

Using a large (2,935-L) mobile swim tunnel, the swimming performance of adult bighead and adult silver carp was quantified at water velocities that challenged them to exhibit either prolonged and/or burst swimming (76-244cm/s) with fatigue times of less than 10min. Simple log-linear models best described the relative swim speed to fatigue relationships for both species. Under these conditions, the swimming performances of adult bighead and silver carp were similar to several species of adult fishes native to the Mississippi River system, but relatively low (<3 total body lengths per second, TL/s) compared to previously studied juveniles and sub-adult bigheaded carps (3-15TL/s). The decline in endurance with water velocity was three times greater in bighead carp (slope=-2.98) than in silver carp (slope=-1.01) and the predictive ability of the bighead model was appreciably better than the silver carp model. The differences in adult swimming performance between the two species were coincident with behavioral differences (e.g. breaching in silver carp but not in bighead carp). The swimming performance data of adult bighead and silver carp can now be used to evaluate whether their passage through manmade river structures including the gates of lock-and-dams in the Upper Mississippi River might be reduced."

To assess the likelihood of BHC establishment and their likely effects on the food web of Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, we developed a multi-species individual-based bioenergetics model that tracks individual bighead and silver carp, four key fish species, and seven prey biomass groups over 50 years. The model tracks the daily consumption, mortality and growth of all individuals and the biomass dynamics of interacting prey pools. We ran simulation scenarios to determine the likelihood of BHC establishment under initial introductions from 5 to 1 million yearling and older individuals, and assuming variable age-0 carp survival rates (high, intermediate, and low). We bounded the survival of age-0 BHC as recruitment continues to be one of the biggest unknowns. We also simulated the potential effects of an established population of 1 million bighead carp or silver carp assuming variation in age-0 survival. Results indicated that as few as 10 BHC could establish a population assuming high or intermediate age-0 survival, but at least 100,000 individuals were needed to establish a population assuming low age-0 survival. BHC had negative effects on plankton and planktivorous fish biomass, which increased with BHC density. However, piscivorous walleye Sander vitreus appeared to benefit from BHC establishment. The potential for BHC to establish and affect ecologically and economically important fish species in Saginaw Bay is a cause for concern."

We used stable isotope analysis to quantify the ecological effects of introduced Bighead Carp (Aristichthys nobilis) stocking in Ulungur Lake on the basal food source composition, isotopic niche width and niche overlap of four dominant fish species including Bighead Carp, Pond Smelt (Hypomesus olidus), Common Bream (Abramis brama) and Common Carp (Cyprinus Carpio). Following Bighead Carp stocking, proportional contributions of phytoplankton to fishes significantly decreased for the other fishes (P < 0.05), and the contributions of particulate organic matter to the fishes significantly increased (P < 0.05) except for Common Bream. In addition, the total isotopic niche width of fishes increased from 12.01 to 13.06 and isotopic niche overlap between fishes increased from 22.75% to 42.50% following stocking; this change was particularly apparent in the large changes in the isotopic niche overlap between Common Bream and Bighead Carp (from 67 to 95%) and between Common Bream and Pond Smelt (from 65 to 100%), followed by that between Bighead Carp and Pond Smelt (from 0 to 90%). Furthermore, the obvious increase in isotopic niche overlap may be the reason for the reduced growth observed in Bighead Carp and in Pond Smelt. These findings highlighted that Bighead Carp stocking changed the availability of basal food sources for other sympatric fishes and increased the potential for interspecific competition among fishes. Overall, our study suggested the introduced Bighead Carp stocking had undesirable effects on fish community in Ulungur Lake."

Settling characteristics are different depending on the physical and biological properties (such as density, diameter and surface viscosity). In this study, the terminal settling velocities of the floating eggs of four carps at different water hardening stages were measured. The terminal settling velocities of the eggs gradually decreased with water hardening process. The terminal settling velocity of the eggs of bighead carp was highest, followed by black carp, silver carp and grass carp. Subsequently, an empirical formula describing the relationship between the drag coefficient and the Reynolds number was developed. The applicability of this formula was investigated in drifting experiments. We proposed a formula for calculating the drag coefficient of floating fish eggs. The drag coefficient formula of the floating fish eggs is suitable for the Reynolds numbers below 490. At Reynolds numbers > 490, the drag coefficient was about 0.12. The results show that floating fish eggs differ significantly from other solid particles in their behavior and an own formula is necessary. This is the first study on the drag coefficient of the floating fish eggs. It further provides new insight on the movement of floating fish eggs in water and can be used in numerical simulation to describe the transport of floating fish eggs, essential for carp protection."

To explore the mechanism of alien species invading a stable food web, a patch dynamic model is established to describe the patch occupancy of each species in the omnivorous food web. A species as invader will be introduced to the food web on different tropical level as predator or as prey. The impact of invasion on the persistence of all species in formed food webs under different habitat loss and habitat fragmentation is investigated. The results show: (1) Compared with invasive species being predators, invasive species being prey is easy to success in omnivorous food webs; Invasive species are much more tolerant of habitat loss and fragmentation when they invade an omnivorous food web in the role of prey than when they invade in the role of predator. (2) When invasive species is a predator in different trophic levels on omnivorous food webs, it shows different coexistence patterns varying with the role and habitat structure. The degree of habitat loss and habitat fragmentation also affects the habitat patch occupancy of the invasive species. On most habitat structure, the lower the trophic level of the invasion location, the more successful the invasion is. (3) When invasive species is a prey of species in omnivorous food webs, no matter what trophic level the invasive species is, it is easy to success. (4) The degree of habitat loss and fragmentation combined with colonization rate have certain impact on invasion result under different roles and trophic levels.

In order to evaluate the ecological effects of controlling algae by silver and bighead carps in early eutrophication lakes. In 2016, a little biomanipulation in-situ pen with the stock of silver and bighead carps was built to control cyanobacterial blooms in Hongshan Bay of Lake Erhai. The changes of plankton community structure and water environmental factors were compared and analyzed within and outside the pen. Meanwhile, the growth and feeding rhythm of silver and bighead carps were measured. The pen-cultured silver and bighead carp all displayed normal growth, the survival environment of the pen is suitable. Daily rations of silver and bighead carp were estimated by Egger's model in the main growing season. Filtration rate was calculated from the daily ration and the density plankton in the lake. Daily rations of silver and bighead carp was 24.96% and 18.18%. The daily rations silver carp is higher than that of bighead carp. Filtration rates of silver and bighead carp for phytoplankton were 3.01 L/(g·h) and 2.19 L/(g·h), respectively, and filtration rates for zooplankton were 13.54 L/(g·h) and 18.61 L/(g·h), respectively. Silver carp had a stronger ability of eliminating phytoplankton than bighead carp. Bighead carp had a stronger ability of eliminating zooplankton than silver carp. During the study, there was no significant difference in the environmental parameters within and outside the pen. The biomass of Microcystis reached its peak in July (1.7 mg/L in the fish pen and 2.4 mg/L in the surrounding lake water). The Microcystis biomass was significantly lower in the pen. The present stocking density of silver and bighead carp(about 20 g/m3 in June)was effective to control Microcystis. From June to August, the reduction rate of the phytoplankton in the silver and bighead carp gradually increased, and the rate of reduction was up to 64% in August. When phytoplankton's dominant species Chlorophyta and diatom replace Microcystis, the rate of reduction decreased gradually, with negative values in October and November. Furthermore, the biomass of crustacean zooplankton biomass and cladocerans biomass were significantly lower in the pen. Therefore, in combination with several experimental results, silver carp had a stronger ability of eliminating phytoplankton than bighead carp. Especially for Microcystis blooms, silver carp at the same time have the higher on the reduction ability of crustacean zooplankton. We need to further analyze the suitability of non-traditional biological manipulation in the early stage of eutrophication Lake Erhai."

Here, planktivorous (silver carp and bighead carp), omnivorous and carnivorous fish with different dietary strategies were selected from two reservoirs, one with on-going aquaculture (WJD) and another without aquaculture (HF) in Southwest China. We compared the total mercury (THg), methylmercury (MeHg) contents and PUFA profiles of fish and their potential diets in these two reservoirs. THg and MeHg contents in omnivorous and carnivorous fish were lower from the WJD Reservoir, which is related to the lower THg and MeHg contents in the artificial fish food. THg and MeHg contents in silver carp from the WJD Reservoir were lower than those from the HF Reservoir, while they were similar in bighead carps from the two reservoirs. The Hg variation in planktivorous fish were inconsistent with that in plankton. THg contents in phyto- and zooplankton from the HF Reservoir were higher than those from the WJD Reservoir, yet their MeHg contents were similar. Artificial fish food which contained higher total PUFA eicosapentaenoic (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), significantly increased the total PUFA and EPA + DHA contents in carnivorous fish, but had less effect on that in omnivorous fish from the WJD Reservoir. Eutrophication caused by aquaculture reduced total PUFA and EPA + DHA contents of plankton in WJD, yet did not reduce those in planktivorous fish. The impacts of aquaculture on Hg and PUFA accumulated in fish were varied among different fish species, and the mechanism needs further exploration. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Science & Technology - Other Topics"	"Since they were first introduced to the United States more than 50 years ago, invasive carp have rapidly colonized rivers of the Mississippi River Basin, with detrimental effects on native aquatic species. Their continued range expansion, and potential for subsequent invasion of the Great Lakes, has led to increased concern for the susceptibility of as-yet uncom-promised lotic and lentic systems in the central United States. Because invasive carp eggs and larvae must drift in the river current for the first several days following spawning, numerical drift modeling has emerged as a useful technique for determining whether certain river systems and reaches have the potential to support suspension-to-hatching survival of invasive carp eggs, a critical first step in recruitment. Here we use one such numerical modeling approach, the Fluvial Egg Drift Simulator (FluEgg), to estimate bighead carp (Hypophthal-michthys nobilis) egg hatching success and larval retention in a 47.8-kilometer (km) reach of the multi-thread St. Croix River, Minnesota and Wisconsin, United States. We explore three approaches for obtaining the hydraulic data required by FluEgg, parameterizing the model with either (a) field hydraulic data collected within the main channel during a high-flow event, or hydraulic data output from a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model with both (b) steady, and (c) unsteady flows. We find that the three approaches, along with the range of water temperatures and discharge used in simulations, produce vastly different predictions of streamwise transport and in-river egg hatching probability (0% for field data, 0 to 96% for steady-state hydraulic modeling, and 1.8 to 65% for unsteady modeling). However, all FluEgg simulations, regardless of the source of hydraulic data, predicted that no larvae reach the gas bladder inflation stage within the study reach where nursery habitat is abundant. Overall, these results indicate that the lower St. Croix River is suitable for invasive carp spawning and egg suspension until hatching for a range of discharge and water temperatures. These results highlight the role of complex channel hydraulics and morphology, particularly multi-thread reaches, and their inclusion in ecohydraulic-suitability modeling to determine susceptibility of river systems for invasive carp reproduction. Our work also emphasizes the scientific value of multi-dimensional hydrodynamic models that can capture the spatial heterogeneity of flow fields in geomorphically complex rivers. This work may help to guide management efforts based on the targeted monitoring and control and improve invasive carp egg and larvae sampling efficiency."

In addition, silver carp (H. molitrix) present a danger of injury and death to unsuspecting boaters, water skiers or recreational fishers due to their propensity to jump in response to boat motor noise. Fishing-down bigheaded carp populations for human consumption will reduce environmental damage and potential human injury and mortality until other control measures become available. The name "carp" conveys an extremely negative brand name for purposes of product marketing. We suggest that the silver carp be renamed by the professional scientific community to silverfin (a trademarked name currently used in culinary circles) and the bighead carp (H. nobilis) to bighead. The suggested common names changes represent a simple, albeit small step to reducing bigheaded carp population numbers based on sound product naming strategies developed and used in marketing science."

Rapid assessments may be possible through the application of a combination of bioenergetic and population dynamic models. Paddlefish (Polyodon spathula) is a native species in the central USA with a history of population decline due to waterway development and overharvesting for roe. It is not known whether paddlefish are impacted by resource competition from invasive bigheaded carp populations, including silver (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis), which have expanded dramatically in the Mississippi River. We used bioenergetic models to project the potential impact of invasive silver and bighead carp on zooplankton density and paddlefish somatic growth in backwater habitat. Bioenergetic outputs were translated to impacts on fecundity, becoming inputs for 50-year metapopulation simulations of backwater habitat connected to the main-stem Mississippi River by episodic flood events. Competition with carp reduced growth and increased the risk of population decline for paddlefish. Impacts increased disproportionately with increased carp abundance and were further exacerbated in scenarios with increased diet overlap or decreased zooplankton abundance. We also analysed paddlefish condition data collected at sites near the lower Mississippi River with varying histories of carp invasion. These data give credence to the bioenergetic model output; paddlefish had reduced body condition at sites with long-established, high-density carp populations. We conclude that invasive bigheaded carps have great potential to reduce paddlefish growth, fecundity, and abundance. The pairing of bioenergetics and population models is likely to be broadly useful in assessing the risks posed by other invasive species."

We examined the tensions and conflicts facing invasive Asian carp management in Minnesota by conducting 16 in-depth interviews with state and federal agency officials, academics, and stakeholders. Interviewees discussed the tensions and conflicts they saw impacting management, their implications, and what could be done to address them. We found three key areas of conflict and tension in Asian carp management: 1) scientific uncertainty concerning the impacts of Asian carp and the efficacy and non-target effects of possible management actions; 2) social uncertainty concerning both the lack of societal agreement on how to respond to Asian carp and the need to avoid acting from apathy and/or fear; and 3) the desired approach to research and management – whether it is informed by “political need” or “biological reality”. Our study of these tensions and conflicts reveals their importance to Asian carp management and to invasive species management, more broadly. We conclude with a discussion of possible ways to address these areas of tension and conflict, including the potential of deliberative, participatory approaches to risk-related decision making and the need to productively engage with apathy and fear."

Since the introduction of invasive carps, such as Silver, Bighead, Common and Grass tarp, managers and researcher have been struggling to remove these species while also hypothesizing the detriment of further invasion. This study developed a food web model of four locations on the Mississippi River and used those models to assess the impacts of two scenarios: carp removal and carp invasion. In the Middle Mississippi River where these invasive carps are already present, the models found that it would take a sustained exploitation of up to 30% of initial biomass over an extended period to remove Grass Carp and up to 90% removal of initial biomass to remove Silver and Bighead Carp. In the locations where Silver, Bighead, and Grass Carp are not yet established (i.e., Pools 4,8, and 13) the invasion of these species could cause declines from 10 to 30% in initial biomass of native fishes as well as already established nonnative invasive species.

However, the composition, diversity, and function of microbiota associated with certain niches in fish bodies and fish habitats remain to be elucidated. In the present study, 16S sequencing was carried out to compare microbial communities found in the gills and guts in two filter-feeding fish (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and to determine the influence of sediment and water on fish microbiota in an unfed aquaculture system. Results revealed significant variations in the water, sediment, gill, and gut microbial communities of the two filter-feeding fish in terms of composition, core taxa, diversity, and predictive function. Microbial diversity was significantly higher in the habitat samples (water and sediment) than in the fish host samples (gill and gut) and was significantly higher in the gills than in the gut. Both body niche (i.e., gill vs gut) and host species significantly impacted the fish-associated microbiota, but permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and cluster analysis of core taxa indicated that the effect of body niche outweighed that of the host species in influencing the microbial community. Host microbial communities were more similar to the water microbiota than the sediment microbiota. Source tracking analysis further confirmed that water had a greater contribution than sediment to the fish microbiota, consistent with their upper water-layer habitats. The gill and gut possessed unique core microbiota and predictive functions in comparison to the surrounding environment.

Fisheries"	"The Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Bighead Carp H. nobilis are two species of invasive bigheaded carp currently invading North American rivers and watersheds. Bigheaded carp were accidentally introduced into the lower Mississippi River basin in the early 1970s and have since invaded many water bodies in the Midwestern United States. Evidence of bigheaded carp reproduction and recruitment in the upper Mississippi River upstream of Lock and Dam 19 (LD19) at Keokuk, Iowa, thought to be a critical constriction point to their upstream establishment, has been limited to a few isolated detections of eggs, larvae, and juvenile life stages since 2012. Therefore, a more comprehensive assessment of bigheaded carp reproduction in this critical management zone was needed. We used quadrafoil light traps (n = 1,387) deployed during May-September 2016-2018 in Pools 17-19 of the Mississippi River to monitor for advanced larval bigheaded carp in low-velocity habitats. Throughout the sampling period, we captured 1,747 larval and 35 postlarval bigheaded carp (N = 1,782). Bigheaded carp were collected on 15 sampling events that spanned from May 31, 2016, to September 13, 2018, with associated hatch dates estimated to represent 10 unique reproductive events from May 2016 to September 2018. The individual captures and backdated hatch estimates revealed a protracted spawning period of up to seven events in 2016, one event in 2017, and two events in 2018. Bigheaded carp were only captured in Pool 19, possibly due to the drifting requirements for egg maturation and the low-velocity downstream reach of Pool 19. This research provides confirmation that bigheaded carp spawned upstream of LD19 are capable of transitioning past the yolk sac stage upstream of this bottleneck to more advanced larval stages. Knowledge of reproduction and larval retention and the field-based evidence of protracted spawning fill critical research gaps needed for the management of bigheaded carp."

Despite observed F-1 hybrid superiority in experimental settings, effects of postzygotic selection on bighead and silver carp hybrids have not been tested in a natural system. Individual parent and hybrid genotypes were resolved at 57 species-specific loci and used to evaluate postzygotic selection for body condition (W-r) and female reproductive potential (presence of spawning stage gonads and gonadosomatic index [GSI]) in the MRB during 2009-2011. Body condition in the Marseilles Reach, Illinois River declined with a decrease in species-specific allele frequency from 1.0 to 0.4 for each species and early generation hybrids (F-1, F-2, and first-generation backcross) had lower mean W-r than late generation hybrids (2nd+ generation backcrosses) and parentals. Proportions of stage IV and stage V (spawning stage) female gonads differed between bighead and silver carp, but not among parentals and their early and late generation hybrids within the MRB. Mean GSI values did not differ between parentals and hybrids. Because reproductive potential did not differ between hybrids and parentals, our results suggest that early generation hybrids occur in low frequency either as a factor of poor condition (W-r) and postreproductive survival, infrequent reproductive encounters by parental bighead and silver carp, or selection pressures acting on juvenile or immature life stages. Our results suggest that a combination of genetic and environmental factors may contribute to the postzygotic success of bighead and silver carp hybrids in the Mississippi River Basin."

We tested varying concentrations of different inhibitors (humic, phytic, and tannic acids; crude leaf extracts) for impacts on quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays designed for eDNA surveys of bighead and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). We also tested for inhibition by high concentrations of exogenous DNA, hypothesizing that DNA from increasingly closely related species would be increasingly inhibitory. All tested inhibitors impacted qPCR, though only at very high concentrations - likely a function, in part, of having used an inhibitor-resistant qPCR solution. Closer phylogenetic relatedness resulted in inhibition at lower exogenous DNA concentrations, but not at relatively close phylogenetic scales. Inhibition was also influenced by the qPCR reporter dye used. Importantly, different qPCR assays responded differently to the same inhibitor concentrations. Implications of these results are that the inclusion of more than one assay for the same target taxa in an eDNA survey may be an important countermeasure against false negatives and that internal positive controls may not, in the absence of efforts to maximize inhibition compatibility, provide useful information about the inhibition of an eDNA assay."

However, in order for eDNA monitoring to mature as a research and management tool, there are several critical knowledge gaps that must be filled. One such gap is the fate of eDNA materials in the aquatic environment. Understanding the environmental factors that influence the decay of eDNA and how these factors impact detection probabilities over time and space could have significant implications for eDNA survey design and data interpretation. Here we experimentally explore decay of eDNA associated with bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) biological waste collected from an aquaculture filtration system and with sperm collected from captive silver carp (H. molitrix), and how decay may be influenced by differing levels of water turbulence, temperature, microbial load, and pH. We found that the decay patterns of eDNA associated with both H. nobilis biological waste and H. molitrix milt significantly fit monophasic exponential decay curves. Secondly, we observed that the highest temperature we tested resulted in a decay half-life as much as 5.5x more rapid than the lowest temperature we tested. When we suppressed microbial loads in eDNA samples, we observed that overall losses of eDNA were reduced by about 2.5x. When we amended eDNA samples with pond water the half-life of eDNA was reduced by about 2.25x, despite relatively little apparent increase in the overall microbial load. This pattern indicated that species constituency of the microbial community, in addition to microbial load, might play a critical role in eDNA degradation. A shift in pH from 6.5 to 8.0 in the samples resulted in a 1.6x reduction in eDNA half-life. Water turbulence in our study had no apparent effect on eDNA decay. When we combined different temperature, pH, and microbial load treatments to create a rapid decay condition and a slow decay condition, and tracked eDNA decay over 91 days, we observed a 5.0x greater loss of eDNA by Day 5 under rapid decay conditions than under slow decay conditions. At the end of the trials, the differences in eDNA loss between the rapid decay and baseline and slow decay conditions were 0.1x and 3.3x, respectively. Our results strongly demonstrate the potential for environmental factors to influence eDNA fate and, thus, the interpretation of eDNA survey results."

Fisheries"	"Bighead Carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, Silver Carp H. molitrix, and Grass Carp Ctenopharyngodon idella (collectively termed "Asian carp") were introduced into North America during the 1960s and 1970s and have become established in the lower Mississippi River basin. Previously published evidence for spawning of these species in the upper Mississippi River has been limited to an area just downstream of Dam 22 (near Saverton, Missouri). In 2013 and 2014, we sampled ichthyoplankton at 18 locations in the upper Mississippi River main stem from Dam 9 through Dam 19 and in four tributaries of the Mississippi River (Des Moines, Skunk, Iowa, and Wisconsin rivers). We identified eggs and larvae by using morphological techniques and then used genetic tools to confirm species identity. The spawning events we observed often included more than one species of Asian carp and in a few cases included eggs that must have been derived from more than one upstream spawning event. The upstream extent of genetically confirmed Grass Carp ichthyoplankton was the Wisconsin River, while Bighead Carp and Silver Carp ichthyoplankton were observed in Pool 16. In all these cases, ichthyoplankton likely drifted downstream for several hours prior to collection. Higher water velocities (and, to a lesser extent, higher temperatures) were associated with an increased likelihood of observing eggs or larvae, although the temperature range we encountered was mostly above 17 degrees C. Several major spawning events were detected in 2013, but no major spawning events were observed in 2014. The area between Dam 15 and Dam 19 appears to be the upstream edge of spawning activity for both Silver Carp and Bighead Carp, suggesting that this area could be a focal point for management efforts designed to limit further upstream movement of these species."

Economic value"	"The impacts of aquatic invasive species (AIS) on the recreational fishery in the Laurentian Great Lakes are of concern to managers and policy makers. Some AIS have the potential to depress sportfish populations, reducing recreational fishing opportunities and damaging local economies. Alternatives that could reduce the threat of AIS could be costly. Assessments of how AIS could affect recreational fishing participation and the economic value derived from it would contribute to the evaluation of these alternatives. We assessed best-case and worst-case scenarios for how a range of AIS could affect recreational fishing participation and economic value. We utilized previously developed scenarios for how AIS could affect sportfish populations as input for a recreational fishing model developed by Ready et al. (2018). Their model estimated changes in fishing participation and economic value from such scenarios. Given uncertainty in how AIS could affect sportfish, projected effects of AIS on economic value varied widely, with some scenarios likely to have minimal effects and others leading to losses of over $100 million annually. None of the scenarios would lead to a large percentage decrease in recreational fishing in the eight Great Lake states, largely because anglers have numerous inland fishing opportunities. Nevertheless, lakeshore communities dependent on Great Lakes fishing could still suffer considerable economic loss. Collectively the economic valuation of the range of scenarios narrows down the possible impacts on fishing and the economy that decision makers need to consider."

We assessed the presence (male) or absence (female) of bony ctenoid serrations on the upper edge of the foremost pectoral fin ray to noninvasively and nonlethally determine the sex of 745 Bighead Carp collected from March to December. Bighead Carp sex was correctly assigned 93% of the time by three readers, with males correctly identified 94% of the time and females 92% of the time. A generalized linear model indicated that total length and water temperature influence the success of sex assignment. Overall effects of water temperature and size were relatively low, as the pectoral fin method was highly accurate (93%) and precise (88% agreement among readers). Thus, the pectoral fin method provides reliable Bighead Carp sex assignment that can be used on wild-caught fish to noninvasively and rapidly assign sex in the field or lab."

Fisheries"	"Fishes utilize several different species-specific reproductive strategies adapted to their environment. Invasive species may display reproductive strategies that allow successful reproduction in varying environments, such as batch and protracted spawning. Bighead Carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and Silver Carp H. molitrix, referred to as bigheaded carp, are invasive species that have been introduced worldwide. In some invaded ranges, they either have a protracted spawning period and/or spawn multiple times in a season, which can be advantageous in novel environments. Reproductive strategies can vary between river systems or with environmental conditions, and understanding differences in strategies can improve management of bigheaded carp. To determine reproductive strategy, we evaluated the histology of spawning capable ovaries from Silver Carp (n = 58) and Bighead Carp (n = 38) collected during May-September 2016 and June 2017 from Pools 17-20 of the upper Mississippi River (UMR). We found that 87.9% of Silver Carp (n = 51) and 86.8% of Bighead Carp (n = 33) had an ovary that contained primary growth, cortical alveolar, and vitellogenic oocytes simultaneously. Multiple stages of oocytes within an ovary indicated that individuals were capable of spawning multiple times during a single year, and the presence of postovulatory follicle complexes demonstrated that individuals had already spawned while oocytes were still present. Based on histological samples, bigheaded carp appear to be indeterminate batch spawners, with oocytes continuing to develop throughout the spawning period. Silver and Bighead carp in the UMR may exhibit protracted and batch spawning and employ flexible spawning strategies among different river systems, which can increase the probability of successful recruitment in a variable environment."

Fisheries"	"Fecundity is a necessary metric to assess reproductive potential (e.g., spawning potential ratio and recruitment overfishing) in invasive fishes, yet the direct measurement of fecundity is often difficult, impractical, and time consuming. Therefore, the ability to estimate fecundity from field measurements (i.e., TL, relative weight [W-r], or ovary weight) can be a valuable tool for fisheries managers to estimate reproductive potential. The goal of this study was to relate the batch fecundity of invasive Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Bighead Carp H. nobilis to metrics that can be quickly measured to eliminate the need for direct enumeration. Silver and Bighead carp were collected from the upper Mississippi River (UMR) in the summer of 2016 and 2017. Subsamples of mature (spawning capable) ovaries were preserved, enumerated, and then related to ovary weight, TL, weight, and W-r. An equation for estimating Silver Carp batch fecundity from ovary weight in the UMR, corrected for ovary membrane weight, was developed: {ovary weight - [0.222 x (ovary weight(0.7589))]} x 794 (SE = 11). Batch fecundity for Silver Carp from Pools 17-20 of the UMR averaged 1,230,930 +/- 68,983 eggs (mean +/- SE). Ovary weight was the strongest predictor of fecundity, but TL, weight, and W-r also showed significant relationships with fecundity for Silver Carp. Batch fecundity for Bighead Carp averaged 1,043,953 +/- 82,360 eggs, but the number of eggs per gram showed significant spatial variation; therefore, no fecundity equation was developed for this species. Future work should evaluate the frequency of Silver Carp spawns within a season and how batch fecundity varies among multiple spawning events. Fecundity estimates can be used to determine spawning potential ratios, which can help in evaluating management strategies."

Understanding the reproductive potential (fecundity and egg size) of low-density, leading-edge populations is important to inform the management of Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Bighead Carp H. nobilis populations in the upper Mississippi River. Therefore, we compared batch fecundity and eggs/g of ovary subsample (an egg-size surrogate) of Silver Carp (n = 145) and Bighead Carp (n = 75) along a decreasing invasion gradient from Pool 20 (higher abundance) to Pool 17 (lower abundance) in the Mississippi River. Bighead Carp in Pools 17 and 18 (461 +/- 22 eggs/g [mean +/- SE]) had significantly fewer eggs/g than those in Pools 19 and 20 (higher abundance; 483 +/- 13 eggs/g). Log-transformed batch fecundity for Bighead Carp was positively correlated to log-transformed fish length, and batch fecundity was higher in Pools 17, 18, and 19 than in Pool 20. The eggs/g values for Silver Carp, which have been previously shown to be independent of fish length, were similar among all pools (94 +/- 11 eggs/g). Batch fecundity for Silver Carp was significantly higher in Pools 17-19 than in Pool 20, where densities are higher. Our results suggest that at lower densities, Bighead Carp produce more, larger eggs and Silver Carp produce more eggs, which collectively could increase their reproductive success along invasion fronts."

Commercial barge traffic, or tows, moving downstream through the EDBS can facilitate the upstream passage of small fish through the barrier by reducing the voltage gradient of the barrier and causing localized upstream return currents. This study tested whether it is possible to prevent upstream passage of small fish across the barrier by preventing upstream return currents. Measurements of water velocity, voltage gradient, and tow speed, as well as sonar-based observations of resident fish, were made as a tow transited the EDBS moving downstream. The results indicate that upstream return currents can be prevented for typical flow conditions in the CSSC (ambient velocity = 0.15 to 0.23 m/s) when tow speeds are <0.46 m/s. Similarly, increasing the ambient velocity above typical values can prevent upstream return currents for faster tow speeds and larger tows. Additionally, preventing upstream return currents at the EDBS may reduce, but does not prevent, tow-mediated upstream fish passages because tows also cause a temporary reduction in the streamwise voltage gradient at the EDBS. These results have implications for the management of invasive bigheaded carps in the Illinois Waterway. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Association for Great Lakes Research."

In the past decades, bighead and silver carp have been introduced from the Yangtze River to many river systems in China, including the Pearl River, in annual, large-scale, stocking activities to enhance wild fisheries. Nonetheless, few studies have assessed the ecological or genetic impacts of such introductions on native conspecific fish populations. An mtDNA D-loop segment of 978 bp from 213 bighead carp samples from 9 populations and a 975 bp segment from 204 silver carp samples from 10 populations were obtained to evaluate genetic diversity and population integrity. Results from a haplotype network analysis revealed that most haplotypes of the Pearl River clustered with those of Yangtze River origin and only a small proportion were distinct, suggesting that both the native Pearl River bighead and silver carp populations are currently dominated by genetic material from the Yangtze River. The genetic diversity of Pearl River populations is high in both species because of this inter-population gene flow, but the diversity of native Pearl River populations is low. To preserve the native genetic diversity, stocking of non-native fingerlings should cease immediately and native Pearl River bighead and silver carp fish farms should be established. This research demonstrates the danger to native biodiversity across China because of the substantial, ongoing stock-enhancement activities without prior genetic assessment."

In China, Asian carp is a tasty dish and has been consumed for thousands of years. However, they are considered aggressive invasive species that threaten rivers, lakes, and indigenous species in the United States.  Asian carp have proliferated greatly in the water basin of the Mississippi River
and its tributaries, and they have caused severe ecological problems over the past 20 years. In recent years, several state governments along the Mississippi River have implemented assistance programs to eliminate invasive Asian carp, but these did not alleviate the threat. We conducted a survey to understand consumers’ attitudes toward Asian carp in the United States, and related reports were reviewed to explore the possibility of Asian carp as food fish on American tables.  Emphasis is placed on the farming history, functional characteristics, consumption preferences, and successful utilization methods for Asian carp in China. In addition, suggestions and possible utilization methods were proposed to improve the negative impression of Asian carp in the United States. Further research is needed to take full advantage of this huge excellent source of food or health supplements. This review provides ideas and directions for the use of Asian carp in the United States. We believe that through effective cooperation between China and the United States, the negative aspects of Asian carp in the United States could be diminished, and a mutually beneficial situation could be achieved."

Hydraulic conditions and water temperature control spawning locations, egg survival, and the downstream distance traveled before the hatched larvae can swim for low velocity nursery habitats. Existing egg drift models simulate the fluvial transport of carp eggs but have limitations in capturing the effect of localized turbulence on egg transport due to inadequate dimensions of hydrodynamics and/or empirical parameterization of river dispersion. We present a three-dimensional Lagrangian particle tracking model that uses fully resolved river hydrodynamics and a continuous random walk algorithm driven by local turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate. We incorporate a new set of equations to compute evolving egg characteristics with fully resolved 3-D hydrodynamics. To demonstrate the performance of the model, we conducted a case study in an eight-kilometer reach of the Missouri River at the discharge of approximately 25% daily flow exceedance. Three-dimensional river hydrodynamics was modeled, calibrated, and evaluated with measurement data. Egg drift was modeled and compared using fully three-dimensional, depth-averaged two-dimensional, and zone-averaged one-dimensional hydrodynamics. The comparison shows a generally good agreement among models of downstream egg transport due to advection but a different dispersion pattern of eggs in the river, as a result of turbulent diffusion and shear induced dispersion."

Among immune defense functions with significant evolutionary divergence, the positively selected biological processes in bighead carp mainly included B cell-mediated immunity, chemokine-mediated signaling pathway, and immunoglobulin mediated immune response, whereas those in silver carp mainly included the antigen processing and presentation, defense response to fungus, and detection of bacteria. Moreover, we found 2974 genes expressed only in spleen of bighead carp and 3494 genes expressed only in spleen of silver carp, where these genes were mostly enriched in the same biological processes or pathways.

Aeromonas hydrophila (A. hydrophila) is the most common zoonotic pathogen in aquaculture, which causes serious economic losses to aquaculture, especially to bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, H. nobilis) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrbc, H. molitrbc). Recent studies along with our previous findings have shown that synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing CpG motifs (CpG ODN) can play a good role in aquatic animals against infection. In order to clarify the relationship between CpG ODN and RBP4 under A. hydrophila infection, firstly, full-length RBP4 cDNAs from H. nobilis and H. molitrbc were cloned. And characteristics of RBP4, including sequence and structure, tissue distribution and genetic evolution were analyzed. In addition, mRNA expression levels of RBP4, cytokine, toll-like receptors (TLRs), morbidity and survival rates of H. nobilis and H. molitrbc were observed post CpG ODN immunization or following challenge. The results indicated that hn/ hm_RBP4 (RBP4 genes obtained from H. nobilis and H. molitrbc) had the highest homology with Megalobrama amblycephala. Distribution data showed that the expression level of hn_RBP4 mRNA was higher than that of hm_RBP4. After CpG ODN immunization followed by A.hydrophila challenge, significantly higher survival was observed in both carps, together with up-regulated RBP4 expression. Meanwhile, hn/hm_IL-1 beta level was relatively flat (and decreased), hn/hm_IFN-gamma, hn/hm_TLR4 and hn/hm_TLR9 levels increased significantly, but hn/ hm_STRA6 showed no significant change, compared with control. Moreover, CpG ODN immunization could induce stronger immune protective responses (higher IFN-gamma/gentle IL-1 beta level and lower morbidity/higher survival rate) against A. hydrophila in H. nobilis, along with higher RBP4 level, when compared with that in H. molitrbc. These results demonstrated that RBP4 was well involved in the immune protection of CpG ODN. Based on the results, we speculated that in the case of A. hydrophila infection, TLR9 signaling pathway was activated by CpG ODN. Subsequently, CpG ODN up-regulated RBP4, and RBP4 activated TLR4 signaling pathway. Then TLR4 and TLR9 synergistically improved the anti-infection responses. Our findings have good significance for improving resistance to pathogen infection in freshwater fish."	"10.1016/j.fsi.2020.03.036"	"internal-pdf://4174186315/1-s2.0-S1050464820302047-main.pdf"

Fish (initial body weight: 2.42 +/- 0.08 g) were hand-fed with six isoproteic (437 g kg(-1)) and isolipidic (68 g kg(-1)) diets containing graded phosphorus levels (0.90, 4.40, 8.30, 11.90, 15.50, and 19.30 g kg(-1)) thrice daily to apparent satiation. Each diet was randomly assigned to triplicate tanks, and each tank was stocked with 30 fish. The highest weight gain rate (WGR, 288.94%) and specific growth rate (2.28% day(-1)) and the best feed conversion rate (FCR, 1.91) were recorded in fish fed 8.30 g kg(-1) phosphorus. The body composition analysis showed that the phosphorus contents in the whole body, muscle, vertebra, and plasma of fish fed the phosphorus-supplemented diets were higher than those of fish fed the control diet, whereas the phosphorus retention rate and crude lipid contents in the whole body and muscle presented the reverse results. The highest activity of lipase (41.97 U g(-1) prot) in the intestine was found in fish fed the diet with 11.90 g kg(-1) phosphorus. Further, the contents of total protein, albumin, and globulin in plasma were increased as dietary phosphorus levels ranged from 0.90 to 11.90 g kg(-1) and then decreased with further increased phosphorus levels. The highest contents of triglyceride (1.85 mmol L-1) and total cholesterol (2.16 mmol L-1) in plasma occurred at dietary phosphorus level of 0.90 g kg(-1). Broken-line model analysis based on WGR, FCR, and the phosphorus contents of the whole body and vertebra indicated that the optimal phosphorus requirements for juvenile bighead carp were 7.16, 9.02, 10.88, and 11.04 g kg(-1), respectively."

There were four treatments with three replicates each: crucian carp (50 fish) fed with low (8.7 g/ kg) or high phosphorous (13.5 g/ kg) diets (L1 and H1), and polyculture (50 crucian carp + 10 silver carp + 10 bighead carp) fed with low or high-phosphorus diets (L3 and H3). Results suggested that polyculture with filter feeders suppresses crucian carp growth, especially when supplied with low phosphorus diet. Polyculture significantly enhanced the total fish production when crucian carp were fed a diet with high P levels. Dietary P level and polyculture with silver and bighead carp did not affect dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, water transparency, NH4+-N, total nitrogen, or any form of phosphorus (p < 0.05), while the presence of filter feeders significantly suppressed plankton. The present experiment suggested that silver carp is more suitable for polyculture with crucian carp, and a higher P level is needed to support plankton and reduce competition with crucian carp."

Whether these carp act as a phosphorus (P) source or sink for phytoplankton is debated. We compared the trophic structures in twenty-three reservoirs with different nutrient concentrations in the flood season (after bigheaded carp introduction) with the dry season (after bigheaded carp harvesting). Fish biomass was positively related to TP, and the slope of the relationship showed no difference between seasons. Bigheaded carp harvesting exceeded the amount introduced, which may explain an observed lower intercept of the relationship and fish biomass to the TP ratio in the dry season. Fish predation pressure on zooplankton (fish: zooplankton biomass ratio as a proxy) was highest in the flood season and increased with TP in both seasons. Accordingly, zooplankton grazing effect on phytoplankton (zooplankton: phytoplankton biomass ratio as a proxy) decreased with fish biomass. Furthermore, both the zooplankton biomass and the zooplankton: phytoplankton biomass ratio were among the lowest reported in the literature for the nutrient range studied. Fish grazing effect on phytoplankton (fish: phytoplankton biomass ratio as a proxy) was also highest in the flood season and decreased with TP in both seasons. Nanoplankton was the dominant phytoplankton group in oligotrophic to mesotrophic reservoirs, while filamentous cyanobacteria dominated in eutrophic reservoirs. Chlorophyll a increased with TP and fish biomass, whereas the yield of chlorophyll a per TP (Chla: TP ratio) increased with fish biomass. Accordingly, both chlorophyll a and the Chla: TP ratio were highest in the flood season. We conclude that bigheaded carp act as P sink at the ecosystem level but as P source for phytoplankton, and enhance the yield of chlorophyll a per TP and thus eutrophication. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to study the effect of nitrite on Aristichthys nobilis, we investigated the oxygen-carrying capacity, NF-kappa B/HIF-1 alpha pathway, and the gill tissue structure under nitrite stress. In the current study, bighead carp (initial weight 180.05 +/- 0.092 g) were exposed to nitrite (48.634 mg/L) for 96 h and then for 96 h recovery test. After nitrite exposure for 6 h, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) mRNA expression increased significantly in the gill of bighead carp (P < 0.05). After nitrite exposure for 12 h, hemoglobin (Hb) and methemoglobin reductase (MHBR) content in blood decreased significantly (P < 0.05); TLR4 mRNA expression increased significantly (P < 0.05). After nitrite exposure for 24 h, methemoglobin (MetHb) content increased significantly (P < 0.05). After recovery test, all the indicators except TLR4 mRNA expression level recovered to initial level. In conclusion, nitrite exposure can affect hemoglobin dynamics, as oxidization of nitrite by hemoglobin results in the reduction of Hb to MetHb leading to hypoxia and nitrite exposure can also result into gill tissue damage. In the face of nitrite exposure, NF-kappa B and HIF-1 alpha mRNA expression level increased immediately to protect the body from oxidative damage and eased hypoxic condition caused by nitrite. It was also observed that nitrite damage is recoverable in Aristichthys nobilis, but it may be need more than 96 h."

Consequently, Asian carp management plans (including contractual harvest) have been implemented to prevent range expansion into vulnerable systems such as the Great Lakes. Asian carp harvest also provides an opportunity to assess if control efforts can benefit native fishes. To answer this question, 26 years of standardized electrofishing data were analyzed, focusing on gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) body condition (W-r) and abundance (catch-per-unit-effort, CPUE) from the Illinois River (Illinois, USA). Gizzard shad data were categorized into pre-Asian carp establishment (1990-1999), after Asian carp establishment (2000-2009), and harvest (2010-2014) periods. Gizzard shad W-r and small gizzard shad CPUE decreased in the entire river after Asian carp invasion, and W-r and large gizzard shad CPUE rebounded where harvest occurred. Contrastingly, small gizzard CPUE has not yet exhibited a positive response to harvest. These mixed results indicate a time-lag may exist between management action and ecosystem response.

Fisheries"	"Planktivorous Bighead Carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and Silver Carp H. molitrix are two invasive species that pose a severe threat to native aquatic biota. Efforts have been made to inhibit Bighead Carp and Silver Carp expansion into the Great Lakes through hydrologically connected systems, but understanding their expansion to and from hydrologically disconnected systems could further reduce this risk. We assessed the origin of 23 Bighead Carp and 1 Silver Carp captured from Chicago Urban Fishing Program ponds using otolith chemistry. Otolith core delta O-18 and delta C-13 of captured Bighead Carp did not overlap with ranges of otolith delta O-18 and delta C-13 from Bighead Carp and Silver Carp from the Illinois River but was consistent with otolith delta O-18 and delta C-13 of Bighead Carp obtained from aquaculture facilities. Likewise, otolith core Sr:Ca of 19 captured Bighead Carp was higher than the range of otolith Sr:Ca from Illinois River Bighead Carp and Silver Carp. Due to inferred timing of introduction (likely age-0 or age-1 fish), these Bighead Carp may have been released incidentally via stocking sport fish shipments contaminated with the carp. Contrastingly, otolith chemistry results suggest that the captured Silver Carp originated from the Illinois River, although timing of introduction of this fish could not be inferred. Overall, our results indicate that nearly all fish analyzed did not originate from rivers within the Mississippi River basin and were instead likely introduced through stocking contaminated shipments of fish. Even though Chicago Urban Fishing Program ponds now pose a minimal threat for Bighead Carp and Silver Carp expansion into Lake Michigan, sustained urban pond monitoring and nonnative fish removal may limit or eliminate this alternative invasion pathway. Additionally, continued vigilance in understanding the origin of stocked fish and culture environment (e.g., polyculture) could decrease the likelihood of future invasive species introductions through contaminated sport fish stockings."

Evolutionary Biology"	"Bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (H. molitrix), collectively called bigheaded carps, are cyprinids native mainly to China and have been introduced to over 70 countries. Paleontological and molecular phylogenetic analyses demonstrate bighead and silver carps originated from the Yangtze-Huanghe River basins and modern populations may have derived from the secondary contact of geographically isolated fish during the last glacial events. Significant genetic differences are found among populations of native rivers (Yangtze, Pearl, and Amur) as well as introduced/invasive environments (Mississippi R., USA and Danube R., Hungary), suggesting genetic backgrounds and ecological selection may play a role in population differentiation. Population divergence of bighead carp or silver carp has occurred within their native rivers, whereas, within the Mississippi River Basin (MRB)-an introduced region, such genetic differentiation is likely taking place at least in silver carp. Interspecific hybridization between silver and bighead carps is rare within their native regions; however, extensive hybridization is observed in the MRB, which could be contributed by a shift to a more homogenous environment that lacks reproductive isolation barriers for the restriction of gene flow between species. The wild populations of native bighead and silver carps have experienced dramatic declines; in contrast, the introduced bigheaded carps overpopulate the MRB and are considered two invasive species, which strongly suggests fishing capacity (overfishing and underfishing) be a decisive factor for fishery resource exploitation and management. This review provides not only a global perspective of evolutionary history and population divergence of bigheaded carps but also a forum that calls for international research collaborations to deal with critical issues related to native population conservation and invasive species control."

Invasive bigheaded carps (Hypophthalmichthys spp.) threaten the Great Lakes ecosystem and are advancing towards Lake Michigan via the Illinois River. Navigation dams on the Illinois River may deter bigheaded carps' upstream movement. We investigated the permeability of the Starved Rock Lock and Dam (SRLD), the most downstream gated Illinois River dam, to bigheaded carps' migration by examining the timing of individuals approaching and passing through SRLD in relation to gate openness, tailwater elevation, and water temperature. Using acoustic telemetry of (N = ~104 per year) tagged fish, 13 upstream passages of bigheaded carps occurred through SRLD between 2013 and 2016. Eleven passages occurred through the dam gates and 2 through the lock chamber, indicating deterrents (e.g., CO2) placed in SRLD lock chamber may only limit passage of a small proportion of all fish passing through the lock-and-dam structure. Passages were documented only in 2013 and 2015. Most of the dam gate passages occurred during high water when gates were completely out of the water. Timing of bigheaded carps approaching SRLD was positively correlated with rising water temperature and high tailwater elevation, and all fish approached during late March through mid-September. Movement through dams is rare; modifying gate operations to reduce gate openness during late spring and summer could further reduce the permeability of gated dams such as SRLD to bigheaded carps, slowing their upstream advance."

Methods and Results The intestinal contents were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq of bacterial 16S rRNA. Cyanophyta and Chlorophyta were the prevalent phytoplankton in the water, whereas Rotifers and Protozoa were the predominant zooplankton. In all, 779,563 quality-filtered sequences and 8870 amplicon sequence variants were obtained from 24 samples that numbered T1A1 to T4A3 and T1B1 to T4B3, resulting in 35 phyla, with Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria and Cyanobacteria dominating. According to alpha diversity and beta diversity measurements, the bacterial communities were diverse, Chao1 richness and Pielou's evenness were significantly lower in the T2B and T4B groups. The gut bacterial communities of T1A, T1B, T2A and T2B groups differed from those of other samples, which formed distinctly clusters with principal coordinate analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis. PICRUSt2 predictive function analysis revealed that different culture patterns influenced the gut microbiota metabolic capacity. Conclusions Intestinal bacteria belonging to the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria and Fusobacteria are better suited to inhabit in various environments and perform specific functions. Furthermore, contact with the external environment and nutrient intake also stimulate the variety of intestinal microbiotas in polycultured bighead carp. Significance and Impact of the Study This is the first comprehensive, high-throughput investigation of gut microbiota diversity in bighead carp during various seasons in two polycultured patterns and provide preliminary information on gut microbiome composition and changes, laying a crucial foundation for future research on fish culture patterns in various environments."

Efforts to control the spread of these invasive species require information on their spatial ecology, though sampling is hindered by their broad extent, habitat tolerances, and species-specific behaviour. Mobile hydroacoustics was used to quantify habitat and depth use of bigheaded carp over fouryears in the heavily invaded Lower Illinois River, a major Mississippi tributary and potential dispersal pathway to the Great Lakes. Horizontally oriented transducers (combined with capture gear for species designation) enabled sampling of the main habitat features in this large flood plain river. Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) were dominant over bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) at all but one site, although habitat use was similar for both species. Densities were highest in lotic backwaters, followed by lentic backwaters and nearshore main channel, with lowest densities in the mid main channel. Bigheaded carp size and species composition were independent of habitat type. Depth associations were similar for both species, with average occurrence at 2.5-3.5m in the main channel and 1-2m in backwaters. However, depth relative to the river bed was largely similar across habitat types. Bigheaded carp density and depth use in the main channel were linked non-linearly to river discharge and water temperature, respectively; densities were reduced during high discharge, whereas depth use became shallower at higher temperatures. Density-hydrology trends were less apparent in backwaters. These findings highlight critical aspects of bigheaded carp spatial ecology that will facilitate effective management in invaded and at-risk ecosystems."

Due to extensive and persistent applications, acetochlor may enter into nearby aquatic ecosystem and cause adverse effects on different animals. The residues of this herbicide via food chain can induce toxic impacts on different animals including public health. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the toxic effects of acetochlor in exposed organisms. The current trial was aimed to know the deleterious effects of acetochlor in fresh water fish. A total of 80 fish were obtained and indiscriminately retained in 4 groups each containing 20 fish. Fish retained in groups (B-D) were exposed to acetochlor mixed in water @ 300, 400 and 500 mu g/L respectively. Blood and different visceral tissues were collected at days 12, 24 and 36 of trial for hematological and histopathological studies. Different behavioral and physical ailments were observed in a time and concentrations manners. Results exhibited significantly (P<0.05) lower hematological profile including erythrocyte counts, hemoglobin, monocyte and lymphocyte count. The serum biochemistry analysis exhibited that the quantity of liver function tests, renal function tests, cholesterol, glucose, and triglyceride in treated fish increased significantly (P<0.05). Histopathological observation showed necrosis, increased Bowman's space and renal tubular degeneration in kidneys. Various microscopic ailments in liver like, hemorrhages, edema, atrophid hepatocyte and hepatocyte with eccentric nuclei were observed in exposed fish. Necrotic neurons, microgliosis and degeneration of neurons in brain while hemorrhages, edema, and neutrophilic myocarditis was observed in heart of treated fish.

Due to frequent and continuous applications, this herbicide can reach nearby water bodies and may induce deleterious changes in aquatic life. Therefore, investigation of harmful impacts of different environmental pollutants, including herbicides, is vital to knowing the mechanisms of toxicity and devising control strategies. The current experiment included bighead carp (n=80) to estimate adverse impacts. Fish were randomly placed in 4 different experimental groups (T0-T3) and were treated for 36 days with acetochlor at 0, 300, 400, and 500 mu g/L. Fresh blood without any anticoagulant was obtained and processed for nuclear and morphological changes in erythrocytes. At the same time, various visceral organs, including the gills, liver, brain, and kidneys, were removed and processed on days 12, 24, and 36 to determine oxidative stress and various antioxidant biomarkers. Comet assays revealed significantly increased DNA damage in isolated cells of the liver, kidneys, brain, and gills of treated fish. We recorded increased morphological and nuclear changes (P <= 0.05) in the erythrocyte of treated fish. The results on oxidative stress showed a higher quantity of oxidative biomarkers and a significantly (P <= 0.05) low concentration of cellular proteins in the gills, liver, brain, and kidneys of treated fish compared to unexposed fish.

Ukraine is among the 24 countries, whose aquaculture and inland fisheries are currently facing medium stress, and will be potentially under higher stress in the future. The purpose of our work was to find a relation between air temperature and its impact on the spreading of infectious in freshwater aquaculture of Ukraine in the context of global climate change. 
Material and methods. During 2011-2017, an epizootiological survey on experimental fishery farms of different patterns of ownership was conducted. The objects of research were the clinically healthy and diseased freshwater fish of different age groups, as well as parasites and bacteria of different etiological groups that affect aquatic organisms. A review of the clinical and parasitological study of different age groups and hybrids of silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Valenciennes, 1844) and bighead carp, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis (Richardson, 1845), common carp, Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758, and some cultured rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum, 1792), and brown trout, Salmo trutta Linnaeus, 1758 were conducted. Research methods common for ichthyopathology, microbiology, and fisheries were used. 
Results. The study on fish diseases was conducted both in aquaculture and natural waters, in particular in the reservoirs of the Dnieper Cascade. Not only the growth and development of fish but also the signs and the course of various diseases appeared to depend on water temperature. The resistance of the fish and other hydrobionts to the influence of threshold temperatures depends on their adaptation to particular factors. In the years with a relatively warm vegetation period, the infection rates significantly increased to 25% and above. A significant broadening of the spectrum of parasitic infections over the last decade has been noted. An ecological misbalance in the ecosystems, an increase in the level of organic pollution of water, and, as a result, in the number of pathogenic microorganisms that may be harmful to fish and human health were registered. 
Conclusion. Taking into account the results of the analytical studies regarding climate change in Ukraine, we can predict outbreaks of bacterial and parasitic diseases in fish in the years to come, which may cause significant economic damage to aquaculture farms."

The present study aims to identify the balance of phosphorus in two cyprinid polyculture ponds based production systems, by applying different rearing technologies and technical solutions. The design of present experiment consists in two ponds (PCP and CP-PP), stocked with common carp (CC), silver carp (SC), bighead carp (BC) and grass carp (GC), where different fish rearing technologies were applied. Also, in case of CP-PP, split-pond technique, together with a particular hydraulic regime was used. The phosphorus input through administrated feed was 165% higher in the case of PCP, compared to the CP-PP. The results obtained by using Sankey diagram revealed higher percentages of phosphorus accumulation in water (> 1000%) and sediments (> 15%), in the case of PCP pond, compared to the CP-PP pond. However, higher percentages of phosphorus accumulation in fish biomass were registered at PCP pond (> 8% in CC, 500% in SC, 150% in BC and > 118% in GC). As a conclusion, by applying split-pond technique, together with a particular hydraulic regime and fish rearing technology, phosphorus footprint of cyprinid polyculture ponds can be reduced, by decreasing the concentration of this element in output water and sediments."

This study aimed to investigate the mechanism in responses to acute nitrite toxicity in bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis, A. nobilis) by RNA-seq analysis. Methods: Bighead carps were exposed to water with high nitrite content (48.63 mg/L) for 72 h, and fish livers and gills were separated for RNA"seq analysis. De novo assembly was performed, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between control and nitrite-exposed fishes were identified. Furthermore, enrichment analysis was performed for DEGs to annotate the molecular functions. Results: A total of 406,135 transcripts and 352,730 unigenes were tagged after de novo assembly. Accordingly, 4108 and 928 DEGs were respectively identified in gill and liver in responses to nitrite exposure. Most of these DEGs were up-regulated DEGs. Enrichment analysis showed these DEGs were mainly associated with immune responses and nitrogen metabolism. Conclusions: We suggested that the nitrite toxicity-induced DEGs were probably related to dysregulation of nitrogen metabolism and immune responses in A. nobilis, particularly in gill."

We investigated the presence of young-of-the-year bighead carp in an irrigation canal network of Northern Italy and the environmental conditions associated with spawning in 2011-2015. The adult bighead carp population of the canal network was composed by large, likely mature, individuals with an average density of 45.2 kg/ha (over 10 fold more than in the main river). The 29 juvenile bighead carp found were 7.4-13.1 cm long (TL) and weighed 9.5-12.7 g. Using otolith-derived spawning dates we estimated that these juveniles were 94-100 days old, placing their fertilization and hatch dates in mid-to-end-June. Using this information in combination with thermal and hydraulic data, we examined the validity of existing models predicting the onset of spawning conditions and the viability of egg pathways to elucidate spawning location of the species. While evidence of reproduction was not found every year, we determined that potentially viable spawning conditions (annual degree-days and temperature thresholds) and pathways of egg drift suitable for hatching are present in short, slow-flowing canals."

Chinese carps cannot reproduce naturally in freshwater reservoirs. Eventually, artificial breeding operations and seeding of the dams with farm-produced fry are carried out by the Technical Centre of Aquaculture every year. Statistical analyses have shown a strong correlation between the landed quantity and the number of fries stocked each year. The impact assessment showed that the risks and benefits associated with the introduction of the three species are variable. Regarding their benefits, it was clear that the herbivorous carp has provided effective and sustainable control of the extensive development of aquatic vegetation in the eutrophic reservoirs and canal systems. The value of the other two species, though, remains less obvious, particularly for the bighead carp. The consequences of their introduction on ecosystems and native species seem to be negligible, especially when the densities are low.

Environmental Sciences & Ecology"	"Natural resource managers use data on the spatial range of species to guide management decisions. These data come from survey or monitoring efforts that use a wide variety of tools. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a surveillance tool that uses genetic markers for detecting species and holds potential as a tool for large-scale monitoring programs. Two challenges of eDNA-based studies are uncertainties created by imperfect capture of eDNA in collection samples (e.g., water field samples) and imperfect detection of eDNA using molecular methods (e.g., quantitative PCR). Occurrence models can be used to address these challenges, thus we use an occurrence model to address two objectives: first, to determine how many samples were required to detect species using eDNA; second, to examine when and where to take samples. We collected water samples from three different habitat types in the Upper Mississippi River when both Bighead Carp and Silver Carp were known to be present based on telemetry detections. Each habitat type (backwater, tributary, and impoundment) was sampled during April, May, and November. Detections of eDNA for both species varied across sites and months, but were generally low, 0-19.3% of samples were positive for eDNA. Overall, we found that eDNA-based sampling holds promise to be a powerful monitoring tool for resource managers; however, limitations of eDNA-based sampling include different biological and ecological characteristics of target species such as seasonal habitat usage patterns as well as aspects of different physical environments that impact the implementation of these methods such as water temperature."

The presence of these alien species and their hybrids in Hungarian natural water bodies may pose significant ecological risks (connected with their phytoplankton and zooplankton consumption). To be able to deal with the ecological risks and to understand the potential of invasiveness of these species, one must have information on the population-level genetic structures of these alien fish stocks. Ten microsatellite DNA markers and one mitochondrial marker were used to address these questions. The results showed that the two stocks are genetically different; the lake population was genetically more diverse and consisted of hybrid and silver carp individuals, while the river population contained only silver carps. The mitochondrial sequences found in the two populations originated from the Yangtze River. Based on the different genetic structures of the stocks, one can assume that bigheaded carps do not reproduce in Lake Balaton, while the Tisza River stock represents significant reproductive potential and may become invasive in this river. Bigheaded carps (bighead carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, and silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and their hybrids play an important ecological and economic role in their original habitat, while their introduced stocks may pose serious ecological risks. To address questions about the persistence and invasiveness of these fish, we need to better understand their population structures. The genetic structures of bigheaded carp populations inhabiting Lake Balaton and the Tisza River were examined with ten microsatellite markers and a mitochondrial DNA marker (COI). The Lake Balaton stock showed higher genetic diversity compared with the Tisza River stock. Based on hierarchical clustering, the Tisza population was characterized only by only silver carps, while the Balaton stock included hybrid and silver carp individuals. All COI haplotypes originated from the Yangtze River. Based on the high genomic and mitochondrial diversity, along with the significant deviation from H-W equilibrium and the lack of evidence of bottleneck effect, it can be assumed that bigheaded carps do not reproduce in Lake Balaton. The present stock in Balaton may have originated from repeated introductions and escapes from the surrounding fishponds. The Tisza stock consists solely of silver carp individuals. This stock appears to have significant reproductive potential and may become invasive if environmental factors change due to climate change."

After escaping captivity, both species spread into the Mississippi River Basin and now threaten to enter the Great Lakes. Human consumption is one solution, but many Americans believe that carp is unsavory. A random sample of 2,000 licensed anglers in Missouri was asked to complete a mail-back questionnaire about Asian carp, yielding a 27% response rate (n = 465). Results indicated that knowledge and perception about carp were poor, and food neophobia (fear of new foods) scores were above average. Less than 15% of respondents had eaten carp, but nearly 53% were willing to try. Marketing should focus on the benefits of consumption while downplaying any possible concerns.

Marine & Freshwater Biology"	"Planktivorous silver carp and bighead carp (collectively, the bigheaded carps) have been stocked worldwide and their invasion has caused severe impacts on many freshwater ecosystems. Exploiting the chance provided by the specific hybrid bigheaded carp stock in Lake Balaton (Hungary) covering the entire morphological range between the two species (including gill raker morphology), we implemented a comprehensive study (1) to reveal the feeding habits of hybrid bigheaded carps living in a mesotrophic, lacustrine habitat and (2) to assess how biotic and abiotic environmental factors and gill raker morphology affect diet composition. We found that all bigheaded carps utilized primarily zooplankton and neglected the scarce and inefficiently digestible phytoplankton, irrespective of gill raker morphology. Moreover, we observed strikingly high levels of inorganic debris consumption, but the proportion of inorganic matter in the guts was not associated directly with the concentration of suspended inorganic particles. Variance in the diet composition of bigheaded carps was related mostly to environmental factors, including the wind-induced resuspension of inorganic particles and seasonally variable availability of food resources. In conclusion, the effects of abiotic environmental factors and available food resources could overwhelm the effect of gill raker morphology in shaping the feeding habits of bigheaded carps."

A pond (10mx5mx1.2m) was divided in half by a concrete-block barrier with a channel (1m across) allowing fish access to each side. Underwater speakers were placed on each side of the barrier opening, and an outboard motor noise (broadband sound; 0.06-10kHz) was broadcast to repel carp that approached within 1m of the channel. Broadband sound was effective at reducing the number of successful crossings in schools of silver carp, bighead carp and a combined school. Repulsion rates were 82.5% (silver carp), 93.7% (bighead carp) and 90.5% (combined). This study demonstrates that broadband sound is effective in deterring carp and could be used as a deterrent in an integrated pest management system."

Previous studies have demonstrated that bighead and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and H. molitrix, respectively) display negative phonotaxis to playbacks of broadband sound recordings produced from a 100 hp outboard boat motor. However. there is concern that acoustic deterrents may impact the movement of non-target native fishes in the Upper Mississippi River. We evaluated the potential impacts of a broadband underwater acoustic deterrent on native ostariophysans [bigmouth buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas)], invasive ostariophysans [bighead carp, common carp (Cyprinus carpio), grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) and silver carp], and native non-ostariophysans [(American eel (Anguilla rostrata), gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), hybrid striped bass (M. saxatilis x M. chrysops), lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) and paddlefish (Polyodon spathula)]. Fish were exposed to playback of the broadband sound (60-10000 Hz), and their behavior was evaluated. Bighead carp showed a strong negative phonotaxis response to the stimulus [12.3 +/- 7.5 (SD) mean consecutive reactions]. silver carp and grass carp showed moderate responses (4.5 +/- 5.2 and 3.8 +/- 3.5 reactions), and common carp displayed low responses (1.3 +/- 1.9 reactions). Of the native fish bigmouth buffalo (2.1 +/- 2.9 reactions) and hybrid striped bass (0.3 +/- 0.5 reactions) were the only species to demonstrate observable response to the acoustic stimulus. Based on this small-scale behavioral screening, acoustic deterrents should have minimal impact on native species, however, larger pond and field trials are necessary to confirm this finding."

Recently, pilot stocking with predatory fish, particularly pike, Esox lucius L., has also been conducted. Hence, an examination of the long-term response patterns of phytoplankton to multiple fish-induced stressors was undertaken. In recent years, Chara domination (2000-2004) has helped to stabilize a clear-water state, high/good ecological status, and meso-eutrophic conditions. After the disappearance of Charales in 2004, the rapid, unstable changes in phytoplankton biomass, structure, and biodiversity suggested a shift toward a turbid-water state. As a result, the phytoplankton assemblages changed from those dominated by cryptophytes Y+X2+X1+LO (2000-2004) through those dominated by cyanobacteria K (2005-2008), dinoflagellates LO+Y (2009-2011), and cryptophytes Y+LO+F+X2 (2012), to those dominated by diatoms D+K+P+A (2013-2014) with representative taxa that occur in nutrient-rich and/or nutrient-poor water bodies. The 1967-2014 changes indicated that four periods, two with clear-water state and two with turbid-water state, alternately, one after the other, resulted from different fish pressure. Higher autochthonous fish biomass was usually accompanied by lower phytoplankton biomass. In contrast, the introduction of Cyprinidae fish had a stimulating effect on summer phytoplankton dominated by cyanobateria. Among the nutrients, only phosphorus played an important role."

Environmental Sciences & Ecology"	"Ecological theory has long recognised the importance of positive and negative species interactions as drivers of food web structure, yet many studies have only focused on competition. Because competitive and facilitative mechanisms operate simultaneously, but through different food web pathways, the balance of their combined effects can produce complex and variable responses. 
We used a response-surface experimental design to assess the roles of negative (e.g. intra-, interspecific competition) and positive (e.g. facilitation) interactions between native and invasive juvenile fishes. We tested whether these interactions alter the densities of planktonic and benthic invertebrates to evaluate the magnitude and mechanism(s) influencing the acceptance or resistance of biological invaders. Interactions between bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) or common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were evaluated in mesocosms. 
Intraspecific interactions were 1.5-2.4 times stronger than interspecific interactions between carp species. The only instance of interspecific competition resulted in bighead carp reducing the daily growth of bluegill, whereas the reciprocal interaction resulted in facilitation. Facilitation occurred when bluegill increased the daily growth of low density bighead carp treatments, despite increased numbers of fishes. Bighead carp also increased densities of benthic Chironomidae larvae, which were subsequently consumed by bluegill, but did not result in enhanced bluegill growth. These suites of interactions were not observed between common and bighead carp. 
Our response-surface design proved useful for comparing the relative magnitude of intra-vs. interspecific competition, identifying facilitation among species, and tracing attendant effects on invertebrate communities. By accounting for the directionality of interactions within our experimental framework and tracking responses of prey at lower trophic levels, we provide a clearer understanding of how competitive effects and stressed consumers alter prey communities and influence facilitation."

Due to the extensive ecological impacts associated with these species, prevention of their further range expansion is the aim for fisheries management. Recent behavioral studies indicate bigheaded carps are deterred by acoustic barriers and exhibit negative phonotaxis in response to anthropogenic sound sources (>= 150 dB re 1 mu Pa). However, the impact of long-term exposure to these sounds on the hearing capabilities of bigheaded carps has not been well documented. In this study, the auditory evoked potential (AEP) technique was used to determine auditory thresholds among bigheaded carps before and after exposure to high intensity (155.7 +/- 4.7 dB re 1 mu Pa SPLrms; - 8.0 +/- 4.7 dB re 1 ms(-2) PAL(rms); mean +/- SD) broadband sound. Fish were exposed to sound for 30 min or 24 h and AEP measurements were taken at three time points: immediately after exposure, 48 h, or 96 h later. Results indicate that silver and bighead carp experience temporary threshold shifts (TTSs) in frequency detection following sound exposure with the magnitude and length of TTS correlated with exposure duration. The findings from this study will be used to increase the long-term efficacy of acoustical deterrent measures aimed at preventing further range expansion of bigheaded carps."

During the initial years of the invasion, concurrent declines in the body condition and the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of planktivorous Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum and Bigmouth Buffalo Ictiobus cyprinellus were attributed to competition with Asian carp. Using an additional seven years of data (2007-2013), we assessed whether Silver Carp have continued to exert adverse pressure on the condition, CPUE, and biomass of native planktivores or whether there is evidence of a potential rebound in the populations of native planktivores. The extended data set reaffirms the body condition and the CPUE of Bigmouth Buffalo remain significantly reduced. However, unlike previous analyses, we also observed significant reductions in the CPUE of Gizzard Shad. Additionally, new results show that the CPUE and biomass of Bigmouth Buffalo were more inversely related to Silver Carp CPUE and biomass relative to the CPUE and biomass of Gizzard Shad. These results reinforce that Silver Carp likely suppress native planktivores and also suggest that diet and other life-history traits may explain some of the subtle differences in species-specific responses. Our results also emphasize that long-term data can be critical to understanding how non-native species can influence native fish population dynamics and how this influence may change over time."

These are now among the dominant fish species in many tropical and some subtropical reservoirs. Eutrophication is assumed to accelerate their population growth. In the present study, we reported a sharp decline in the catch of stocked bighead carp (Itypophthalmichthys nobilis (Richardson, 1845)) with an extreme increase of tilapia catch in a large reservoir in southern China. In 2006, the catch of tilapia was 150 tons, which exceeded the catch of stocked bighead carp, and reached 500 tons in 2015. Long-term meteorological data over the past two decades did not show any significant change, especially in minimum air and water temperatures, which can be factors limiting tilapia growth. In contrast, water quality conditions, including total nitrogen, total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a, chemical oxygen demand, and trophic status, have significantly increased in the reservoir. The phytoplankton community has been mainly composed of small and filamentous species, while the total zooplankton biomass has decreased, with the community now mainly comprised of small rotifers and copepod species. The high ratio of chlorophyll a:TP indicates a weakening top-down effect of zooplankton on phymplankton. The annual tilapia catch was significantly associated with trophic status of the reservoir, but not with meteorological and hydrological factors. We propose an ecological mechanism for increased population densities of the non-native tilapia under eutrophication, in which an increase in tilapia population size has been accompanied by a reduction in their body size, producing a stronger negative impact on zooplankton and water quality, which contributes to the turnover between bighead carp and tilapia catch. The proposed mechanism provides a useful framework for understanding the process and management of tilapia populations in tropical reservoirs."

Identifying new chemicals as part of the biocide registration approval process can require screening millions of compounds. Traditionally, screening new chemicals has been done in vivo using test. organisms. Using in vitro (e.g., cell lines) and in silico (e.g., computer models) methods decrease test organism requirements and increase screening speed and efficiency. These methods, however, would be greatly improved by better understanding how individual fish species metabolize selected compounds. We combined cell assays and metabolomics to create a powerful tool to facilitate the identification of new control chemicals. Specifically, we exposed cell lines established from bighead carp and silver carp larvae to thiram (7 concentrations) then completed metabolite profiling to assess the dose-response of the bighead carp and silver carp metabolome to thiram. Forty one of the 700 metabolomic markers identified in bighead carp exhibited a dose-response to thiram exposure compared to silver carp in which 205 of 1590 metabolomic markers exhibited a dose-response. Additionally, we identified 11 statistically significant metabolomic markers based upon volcano plot analysis common between both species. This smaller subset of metabolites formed a thiram-specific metabolomic fingerprint which allowed for the creation of a toxicant specific, rather than a species-specific, metabolomic fingerprint. Metabolomic fingerprints may be used in biocide development and improve our understanding of ecologically significant events, such as mass fish kills. Published by Elsevier Ltd."

In the Wabash River, there were originally 66 species of freshwater mussels, but now only 30 species with reproducing populations remain. Although there were multiple stressors over the last century, the largest change in Wabash River fish biodiversity was associated with rapid increases in municipal nutrient loading and invasive bigheaded carps. Like similarly neglected large river systems worldwide, the Wabash River has a surprising amount of ecological resilience and recovery. For instance, of the 151 native fish species found in the 1800s, only three species have experienced local extinctions, making the modern assemblage more intact than many comparable rivers in the Mississippi River basin. However, not all the changes are positive or support the idea of recovery. Primary production underpins the productivity of these ecosystems, and the Wabash River phytoplankton assemblages shifted from high-quality green algae in the 1970s to lower less nutritional blue-green algae as nutrient and invasive species have recently increased. Our recommendations for the Wabash River and other altered rivers include the restoration of natural hydrology for the mainstem and tributaries, nutrient reductions, mechanisms to restore historical hydrologic patterns, additional sediment controls, and improved local hydraulics."

For this purpose, bighead carp was cultured with initial weight of 0.5 +/- 0.05 g with selective experimental treatments for 4 months. In this study, treatments included: control (0 g / ha Bio-Aqua (R)), T1 (250 g/ha Bio-Aqua (R)), T2 (350 g/ha Bio-Aqua (R)) and T3 (450 g/ha Bio-Aqua (R)) which they were added to water of earthen ponds. Based on these results, significant difference was observed in specific growth rate, weight gain, daily growth rate, feed conversion ratio and survival in T3 treatment (450 g/ha) compared to the other treatments (p<0.05). Also, there was a significant difference in the crude protein and moisture contents in T3 group compared to control and T1 groups (p<0.05). Moreover, in T3 treatment, total protein, number of red and white blood cells, hemoglobin, PCV, monocytes and neutrophils were significantly higher than the other treatments (p<0.05). Bio-Aqua (R), in T3 (450 g/ha concentration) significantly reduced TSS, BOD, COD, nitrite and phosphate of water in earthen ponds compare to other treatments (p<0.05). This study demonstrated that Bio-Aqua (R) supplement, especially in T3 group (450 g/ha) improved growth performance, nutritional value, survival rate, chemical composition and haematological parameters of bighead carp."

Accomplishing that goal would require significant expenditures to re-engineer waterways in the Chicago, IL area. These costs should be compared to the potential costs resulting from ANS transfer between the basin, a significant portion of which would be costs to recreational fisheries. In this study, a recreational behavior model is developed for sport anglers in an eight-state region. It models how angler behavior would change in response to potential changes in fishing quality resulting from ANS transfer. The model also calculates the potential loss in net economic value that anglers enjoy from the fishery. The model is estimated based on data on trips taken by anglers (travel cost data) and on angler statements about how they would respond to changes in fishing quality (contingent behavior data). The model shows that the benefit to recreational anglers from re-establishing hydrologic separation exceeds the costs only if the anticipated impacts of ANS transfer on sport fish catch rates are large and widespread."

Fish subsequently escaped, and by the 1980s bigheaded carps were widespread and established in the upper Mississippi River, lower Missouri River, and the Ohio River and some of its tributaries. We sampled bigheaded carps in the lowermost reservoirs on the Tennessee River (Kentucky Lake) and Cumberland River (Lake Barkley) in 2015 and 2016 using multiple gears, including gill nets, hoop nets, electrofishing, and cast nets, to describe their distribution and estimate several population attributes. Additional electrofishing samples on the Duck River, a system renowned for its diverse ichthyofauna and mussel communities, revealed that Silver Carp range extends 220 river kilometers (rkm) upstream below the Columbia Dam. We collected a total of 737 Silver Carp and 10 Bighead Carp through the course of this study. The maximum total lengths and ages were 1385 mm and 22 years for Bighead Carp and 1005 mm and 13 years for Silver Carp. The Silver Carp populations in both reservoirs had the same pattern of strong year classes (2010, 2011, 2012, and 2015) and similar growth rates, which were faster than what has been reported for other populations around the globe. Some young-of-year Silver Carp were collected 180 and 110 rkm upstream in Kentucky Lake and Lake Barkley, respectively, and they may represent the first evidence of natural reproduction in those reservoirs or their tributaries."

This study examines the effects of exposure to a 1966.4 cm(3) seismic water gun array (two guns) on the abundance and behavior of Bighead Carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, Silver Carp H. molitrix (collectively referred to as bigheaded carp) and native fishes (e.g., Smallmouth Buffalo Ictiobus bubalus). Water guns were deployed in a channel that connects the Illinois River to backwater quarry pits that contained a large transient population of bigheaded carp. To evaluate the effect of water guns, mobile side-looking split-beam hydroacoustic surveys were conducted before, during and between replicated water gun firing periods. Water guns did not affect abundance of bigheaded carp, but abundance of native fish detected during the firing treatment was 43 and 34% lower than the control and water guns off treatments, respectively. The proximity of bigheaded carp to the water gun array was similar between the water guns on and water guns off treatments. In contrast, the closest detected native fish were detected farther from the water guns during the water guns on treatment (mean +/- SE, 32.38 +/- 3.32 m) than during the water guns off treatment (15.04 +/- 1.59 m). The water gun array had a greater impact on native fish species than on bigheaded carp. Caution should be taken to the extrapolation of these results to other fish species and to fish exposed to water guns in different environments (e.g., reduced shoreline interaction) or exposure to a larger array of water guns, or for use of water guns for purposes other than a barrier."

Here we use the four major Chinese carps (FMCC) in the Laurentian Great Lakes as a case study to categorize and describe the suite of uncertainties inherent in projecting the impact of invasive species with bioenergetics and food web models. We approach this case study in a decision analytic framework, describing structural uncertainties, environmental variation, partial observability, partial controllability, and linguistic uncertainty. Finally, we review and give suggestions for how the use of methods including adaptive management, scenario planning, sensitivity analyses, and value of information as well as efforts to ensure clarity in language and model structure can enable modelers and managers to reduce and account for key uncertainties and make better decisions for the control of invasive species."

Fisheries"	"Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Bighead Carp H. nobilis, collectively known as bigheaded carps (BHC), are invasive fishes in the Mississippi River and surrounding basins. Increasing evidence suggests harmful impacts of BHC on native fisheries (e.g., competition). Monitoring the abundance of BHC is difficult with traditional fisheries gears, and few studies have evaluated early life stage sampling. Identifying the spawning locations of BHC through early life stage sampling has the ability to enhance management efforts by applying focus to areas that have potential to serve as population sources. We evaluated the performance of three gears in sampling larval BHC and native taxa within large-river tributaries in terms of abundance, community assemblage, and size structure. We sampled ichthyoplankton in tributaries with active (push net) and passive (drift net, light trap) gears from March through September 2016. Relative abundance of BHC was greatest in push nets followed by drift nets and was lowest in light traps. Native cyprinids and catostomids as well as BHC comprised a large portion of the total catch. Environmental and habitat characteristics (stream velocity, dissolved oxygen, and temperature) related to BHC reproduction influenced each gear's ability to capture larval BHC, although relationships in final models were not significant. Taxonomic size selectivity existed among gears; in particular, larger BHC were collected in push nets relative to the other gears. Push nets were the most effective in sampling BHC, and remaining gears exhibited unique strengths. Although less effective than active push nets, drift nets proved useful for monitoring BHC in tributaries and may be advantageous in shallow systems with adequate flow. Light traps were ineffective at capturing BHC larvae in tributaries but may offer utility in lentic habitats or for native cyprinids. Our comparison serves as a guide for monitoring larval BHC in their invaded range and for detection in new areas, such as tributaries of the Great Lakes."

We used the Ecopath with Ecosim model framework to evaluate potential risk of BHC population growth and food web effects in four Great Lakes habitats, including mesotrophic waters of Saginaw Bay (Lake Huron) and Lake Erie and the oligotrophic main basins of Lakes Michigan and Huron. We simulated BHC population growth and food web effects under different scenarios of BHC production rates, prey vulnerability to BHCs, and availability of age-0 BHCs to predation by salmonines. In the main basins of Lakes Michigan and Huron, the projected BHC population growth was low or negative, with a projected final BHC biomass of 0.5-1.1 times the initial introductory biomass (2% of total fish biomass for each BHC species), and BHCs had negligible effects on most food web groups across all scenarios. In contrast, in Saginaw Bay and Lake Erie, the projected BHC biomass was 2.5-12.5 times higher than the initial biomass across all scenarios, and the largest increases occurred under scenarios of high prey vulnerability to BHCs and high BHC production rates. High projected BHC biomass in Saginaw Bay and Lake Erie had negative effects on zooplankton and planktivorous fish groups and mixed effects on piscivores but had relatively negligible effects on most other food web groups across all scenarios. Our results are consistent with reported BHC effects on food webs in the Mississippi River and its tributaries and inform efforts to prevent BHC invasion of the Great Lakes."

A mechanistic understanding of interactions between nonnative prey and native predators is needed to assess the potential for predator regulation of Hypophthalmichthys carp populations and impacts on native predator assemblages. We conducted a series of experiments to quantify the selectivity and efficiency of Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides predation on juveniles of both of these Hypophthalmichthys species and behaviors that potentially influence this selectivity and efficiency. Selectivity was measured over 24 h in 2-m-diameter pools containing one of two prey assemblages consisting of three individuals from each of three species: (1) Bighead Carp with native littoral (Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus) and pelagic prey (Golden Shiner Notemigonus crysoleucas) or (2) Bighead Carp, Silver Carp, and a morphologically similar native prey (Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum). Foraging efficiency and predator-prey behaviors were quantified in 45-min trials in which Largemouth Bass foraged on 10 individuals of a single prey species inside a 750-L observation tank. All prey species were readily attacked and consumed by Largemouth Bass; Silver Carp were selected less often than Gizzard Shad, and Bighead Carp were selected at a higher rate than any of the other prey species. Of the species tested, Bighead Carp formed the tightest schools and were captured most efficiently by Largemouth Bass. Overall, Hypophthalmichthys carps were similar to native prey in their vulnerability to Largemouth Bass; therefore, factors affecting Hypophthalmichthys carp availability relative to native prey may shape postinvasion predator-prey interactions."

A better understanding of factors that influence spatial patterns of bigheaded carp reproduction can help fisheries managers to prevent their spread. To examine factors that influence spatial patterns of reproduction, we sampled ichthyoplankton by using drift nets and push nets in three tributaries of the Illinois and Wabash rivers during March-September 2016-2018. We compared relative abundances of bigheaded carp eggs and larvae among tributaries by using CPUE. Abiotic data were analyzed from individual study tributaries and were pooled among tributaries with substantial versus minimal evidence of bigheaded carp reproduction. In total, 5,689 larval bigheaded carp were captured during three sampling seasons. Of the six study tributaries, we captured the most bigheaded carp larvae in the Sangamon River, followed by the Little Wabash, Embarras, Spoon, Mackinaw, and Vermilion rivers. Based on previous literature, we investigated differences in watershed area, discharge, water temperature, turbidity, and free-flowing stretches of river in our study tributaries. In general, tributaries with greater relative abundances of bigheaded carp eggs and larvae had larger watersheds, greater discharge, lower Secchi depths (higher turbidity), and longer free-flowing stretches than those with minimal evidence of reproduction. This study provides a thorough investigation of bigheaded carp reproduction in six large-river tributaries and will help fisheries managers to better monitor and mediate the spread of these invaders by facilitating the prioritization of potential monitoring locations."

Studies have shown that elevated levels of carbon dioxide gas (CO2) have the ability to act as a nonphysical fish barrier, but little work has been done on the efficacy of CO2 to deter fish movement in flowing water. An annular swim flume was used to measure Uburst and sprint duration of the model species largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) across a range of pCO2 levels (< 400 μatm [ambient]; 10,000 μatm; 50,000 μatm; and 100,000 μatm). This species was tested as a proxy because of the likelihood of a similar CO2 response being produced, as well as constraints in obtaining and housing appropriately sized Asian carp. A significant decrease in Uburst swimming occurred when exposed to 100,000 μatm. No effects on sprint duration were detected. In both swimming tests, 15% of fish lost equilibrium when exposed to 50,000 μatm pCO2, while 50% of fish lost equilibrium when exposed to 100,000 μatm. Together, results define target levels for managers to impede the spread of largemouth bass and potentially other invasive freshwater fishes, helping guide policy to conserve aquatic ecosystems."

Surveys and Questionnaires"	"Field studies to detect environmental DNA (eDNA) can be undertaken to infer the presence of a rare or cryptic species in a water body. These studies are implemented by collecting water samples from the water body, processing those samples to isolate genetic material contained in the water sample, and using a laboratory assay to find a species-specific genetic marker within a sample of the genetic material. To date, conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been one of the most widely used assays in field studies to detect eDNA. This assay is strictly a test for the presence of the genetic marker. It provides no estimate of the concentration of the target genetic marker in the sample or in the environment. Understanding the concentration of a target marker in the environment is a critical first step toward using the results of eDNA field surveys to support inferences about the location and strength of eDNA sources. In this study, the results of eDNA field surveys are combined with a model of the sensitivity of the field survey methods to estimate target marker concentrations using Bayesian updating. The method is demonstrated for Asian carp in the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) using the results of field surveys for eDNA carried out during the period 2009 through 2012, a four-year period during which more than 5,800 two-liter water samples were collected and analyzed using PCR. Concentrations of bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) eDNA are estimated for twenty hydrologic reaches of the CAWS. This study also assesses the sensitivity of these concentration estimates to evidentiary criteria that limit what evidence is used in Bayesian updating based on requirements for sampling intensity and frequency."

Four treatments - clam-only, fish-only, combined and controls - were used. In combination, bighead carp (80 g m(-3)) and Asian clam (260 g m(-2)), had a remarkable controlling effect on phytoplankton biomass and improved water quality. By the end of the experiment, the chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration of the combined group was below 5 mu g L-1 compared with 36 mu g L-1 in the clam-only treatments and 31 mu g L-1 in the controls, whereas Chl a in the fish-only group had increased to 211 mu g L-1. Large-sized algae (Microcystis sp.) dominated in the control group and the clam-only group, whereas small-sized algae (Actinastrum hantzschii and Clamydomonas globose) dominated in the fish-only group. The concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in the water column were significantly reduced by clam stocking, regardless of the presence of fish. A 24-h laboratory experiment was conducted to verify whether the excrements produced by clams filtering small-sized algae could be eaten by bighead carp. At the end of the experiment, the density of Scenedesmus obliquus had decreased significantly in the clam-presentmesocosms, and the gut fullness index of bighead carp was significantly higher in the clam-present mesocosms than when clams were absent. Our results show that, under the selected experimental conditions and densities, water clarity improved when bighead carp and Asian clam occurred together, whereas Chl a concentrations and algae biomass increased in the fish-only mesocosms; in the clam-only mesocosms no significant effectswere observed. We suggest that the combination of filter-feeding fish and clams may enhance water clarity and it may therefore potentially be a useful restoration tool. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We tested for AIS and illegal native species in 51 bait and 21 pond stores from the central Great Lakes (Lake Erie, Ohio and Lake St. Clair, Michigan) and the adjacent Wabash River (Indiana) using environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcode assays of water samples and morphological identifications. Retailers were questioned about supply chains, and anglers surveyed about baitfish use and disposal. Assays revealed unadvertised species eDNA in 100% of bait stores, with 61% containing illegal native non-bait (totaling 13 species) and 88% having AIS (11 species). Illegal native non-bait species included juvenile walleye, yellow perch, and white sucker eDNA. AIS eDNA included Eurasian ruffe in seven stores (all states), silver carp in five (including a Lake Erie store in two separate years), and bighead carp in two Lake Erie stores that also had silver carp. Among pond stores, two in Lake St. Clair had bighead carp eDNA, one also contained silver carp, and a Wabash River location showed European ide. Unadvertised invasive snails were discerned in 55% of pond stores. Four contained zebra mussel eDNA and two had invasive bryozoans. Illegal native species and AIS were widespread, but showed little relationship to the retailers' variable and extensive supply chains. Live baitfish releases were reported by 50% of Lake Erie anglers and 35% in Lake St. Clair. Consumer behavior and AIS prevalence in the bait and pond trades thus pose serious risks for introductions and spread."

Methods. Blood samples were taken from silver (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead (Aristichthys nobilis) carps of "Sunpoint Ukraine" LLC, Slobozhanske, Zmiiv district, Kharkiv region. Blood from the tail vein was collected from age-2 and age-3 fish in vivo and placed into tubes with an anticoagulant. Whole blood samples were separated into fractions by centrifugation and as a result plasma and erythrocytes were packed into separate tubes. The methods of vertical polyacrylamide and horizontal starch electrophoresis were used for the electrophoretic separation of proteins and enzymes of silver and bighead carps blood. Histochemical staining of the gel plates was carried out with t) and bighead he following genotyping of allelic variants of protein and enzyme systems. Biochemical systems such as loci of prealbumin (Pralb), esterase (EST, K.F. 3.1.1.1), malate dehydrogenase (MDH, K.F. 1.1.1.37), enzyme malic (ME, K.F. 1.1.1.40) and carbonic anhydrase (CA, K.F. 4.2.1.1) were investigated. Statistical processing of experimental data was performed using Biosys-1. Cluster analysis was carried out using MEGA-X. Results. Analysis of the peculiarities of the distribution of allele frequencies and the genotypic composition of Pralb, EST, MDH, ME, and CA loci was carried out in the age-2 and age-3 groups of silver and bighead carps. The prevalence of the frequency of the fast migrating allelic variant F was revealed in comparison with the slow migrating gene at EST locus in the age-3 group of silver carp (Est F = 0.620). The prevalence of the frequency of the fast allelic variant Pralb A in comparison with the slow Pralb B was observed in the silver carp groups (Pralb A = 0.812 in the age-2 and Pralb A = 0.726 in the age-3 groups. According to the genotypic composition of the studied loci, there was an excess of heterozygous individuals in the age-2 group of silver carp, which indicates their genetic imbalance. The formation of breeding stocks of silver and bighead carps requires control of the level of genetic variability of different age groups to monitor changes in the genetic structure and maintain the optimal level of heterozygosity in stocks. The highest level of average heterozygosity (79.4%) was found in the age-2 group of silver carp, which prevailed over the expected average heterozygosity with a value of 49.4%. In comparison with other studied groups, the age-2 group of bighead carp had the lowest level of average heterozygosity of 59.1% versus the theoretically calculated level of 45.5%. The age-2 and age-3 groups of bighead carp had the highest level of heterozygosity at Ca locus at the level of 82.8 and 78.6% respectively, in contrast to the expected heterozygosity at this locus at the level of 49.9 and 49.7%. A dendrogram of the genetic relationships of different age groups of silver carp was constructed based on the values of genetic distances. The formed clusters indicated the formation of the genetic structure of the silver and bighead carps by species affiliation. Conclusions. The analysis of the genetic structure of different age groups of the silver and bighead carps was performed by the polymorphism of protein and enzyme systems such as Pralb, EST, MDH, ME, CA loci. The study describes the features of the distribution of allelic frequencies and genotypic variants of the aforementioned loci. The level of average heterozygosity, observed and expected heterozygosity at loci in age-2 and age-3 groups of silver and bighead carps were determined. The high genetic variability of an age-2 group of silver carp at the level of 79.4% indicates the need to stabilize their genetic structure. As a result of the cluster analysis, it was determined that the formation of the genetic structure of the silver carp groups of the "Sunpoint Ukraine" farm in the Kharkiv region occurs by species affiliation. The study and use of biochemical markers wi l allow differentiating stocks of silver and bighead carps. As well as in complex analysis with other molecular genetic markers will allow them to develop a genetic passport."

We used of the insecticide 6.6 mg L-1, 10 mg L-1 and 20 mg Li-representing 30, 20, 10 times dilution, and of the fungicide - 30 mg L-1, 38 mg L(-1 )and 50 mg L-1 representing 50, 40, 30 times dilution, respectively. These concentrations were considered as real applicable pesticide concentrations in plant protection practices. Overall, we found pronounced alterations in the gill histological structure such as proliferative and regressive, as well as changes in the circulatory system in the fish treated with both pesticides. The histopathological alterations indicated the negative effects of the applied chemicals on non-target aquatic species such as bighead carp. hi addition, we found that, in terms of the histological lesions and tested fish species, the fungicide had more severe effects compared to the insecticide."

Predicting population collapse and understanding the self-reinforced feedback mechanisms that erode the resilience of native species are two major challenges in invasion ecology. However, to date, empirical evidence of species invasion-induced regime shifts remains scarce, and the minimum required data to generate early warning signals (EWSs) before critical transitions remains unclear, despite its importance for ecosystem management. By combining 80-year (i.e., 1936–2016) fishery data from Lake Qiandao and a theoretical competition model, we provide evidence that relative to nutrient enrichment and climate change, stocking alien fish species of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Aristichthys nobtilis) is the most important driver leading to the collapse of local fish populations. Detectable EWSs indicated by the variance, autocorrelation and composite resilience indicators require at least ten years of data before an abrupt decline, demonstrating that a long-term ecological monitoring program is necessary for providing insight into resilience dynamics. A structural equation model (SEM) suggests that the combined effects of eutrophication, high water levels and carp stocking-induced water clarity decline may play an important role in the reduced fitness of local fish populations, which subsequently increase the carrying capacity of alien fish populations. Our results demonstrate that stocking alien carps result in competitive exclusion of local fish populations, especially in the current context of water eutrophication and global climate changes. Furthermore, quantifying the minimum required time series length with detectable EWS across various ecosystems should be further studied given that this information is critical for flexible management policies to take actions to avert the harmful transitions."

Given that the liver is an important organ for metabolism and detoxification, we hypothesized that optimal dietary protein levels may benefit liver function. Herein, we investigated the effects of dietary protein level on serum biochemistry, liver histology and transcriptome profiling of juvenile bighead carp Aristichthys nobilis fed for 8 weeks on a diet supplemented with high protein (HP, 40%), low protein (LP, 24%) or optimal protein (OP, 32%; controls). The results revealed a significant change in liver morphology in LP and HP groups compared with the OP group, coupled with increased serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis of the liver transcriptome yielded 47 million high-quality reads using an Illumina platform, which were de novo assembled into 80,777 unique transcript fragments (unigenes) with an average length of 1021 bp. Subsequent bioinformatics analysis identified 878 and 733 differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs) in liver in response to LP and HP diets, respectively. KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs identified immune and metabolism-related pathways, including Toll-like receptor signaling, PI3K-Akt signaling, NF-kappa B signaling, complement and coagulation, peroxisome, nitrogen metabolism, PPAR signaling, and glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways. Transcriptome profiling results were validated by quantitative real-time PCR for 16 selected DEGs.

However, the VSF design greatly depends on fish response to hydraulics and swimming behavior, which are key to the design of effective VSFs for target fish species. This study evaluated the effects of hydraulic characteristics on movement behavior of bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) by combining spatial hydraulic distributions with fish movement trajectories in an experimental VSF. Fish spent more transit times in ranges of velocity (V) with 0.15–0.45 m/s, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) with 0.020–0.043 m2/s2, turbulent dissipation rate (TDR) with 0.020–0.065 m2/s3and strain rate (SR) with 2–7 s−1 under different discharges (18.0L/s and 26.0L/s), respectively. Correlation were found between fish transit times and hydraulic variables of velocity (V) (Q = 18.0 m/s: r = 0.397, P < 0.01; Q = 26.0 m/s: r = 0.407, P < 0.01), turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) (Q = 18.0 m/s: r = 0.476, P < 0.01; Q = 26.0 m/s: r = 0.469, P < 0.01). TKE and V were the key hydraulic parameters associated with the fish transit movement times in VSF. The results provided key hydraulic parameters for bighead carp movement in VSFs, which can serve as reference design for the future VSF and others fishway designs for this species."

To mitigate the impact on fish, fish passages have been developed as an effective way to restore riverine connectivity. The design of fish passage facilities refers to both hydrodynamics and fish behavior, and the information on the energetic expenditure of fish can be used to identify movement zones that are suitable for fish migration. Thus, this paper intended to identify fish movement behavior in response to water flow field information by means of estimating the energetic expenditure using an IBM approach. The results demonstrated that the fish required more energy in high TKE zones, and they were therefore likely to utilize the low TKE zones. This study provides a reference for optimizing the design of fish passages, and the method can be applied to assess the efficiency of fish passages and other fish bypass structures. An understanding of fish movement behavior in response to flow field variables is important for exploring the hydrodynamic strategies of fish in fish passages. In this paper, bighead carps were taken as an example. The fish movement behavior response to water flow field information by means of estimating the energetic expenditure using an IBM approach in an experimental fishway was investigated. Fish swimming velocity, drag force, and energy expenditure were analyzed in varied flow conditions related to hydraulic variables, including velocity (V), turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), and strain rate (SR). The result indicated that the fish will require more energy in high TKE zones. This study provides a reference for optimizing the design of fish passages and fisheries management. This method can be applied to assess the efficiency of fish bypass structures and conduct fish survival studies."	"10.3390/ani12131725"	"internal-pdf://0184262343/animals-12-01725.pdf"

Here, we investigated trends in zooplankton communities, densities, and biomass in pools 14-20 of the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) across a gradient of bigheaded carp presence and relative abundance during 2016-2018. We explored the effects of bigheaded carp presence on zooplankton communities using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and assessed taxa-specific relationships with bigheaded carp relative abundance using ordinary least-squares regression with an indicator variable for bigheaded carp presence. Zooplankton communities in the UMR were dominated by rotifers and crustacean zooplankton densities were low, making up only 2% of the community density. Zooplankton communities differed where bigheaded carp were present. Density and biomass of cladocerans and copepods were both reduced where bigheaded carp were present but copepods increased with bigheaded carp relative abundance. Ostracod biomass increased in the presence of bigheaded carp whereas rotifers declined with bigheaded carp relative abundance. Low crustacean zooplankton densities in the UMR may limit larval/juvenile fish growth and recruitment regardless of bigheaded carp, but further declines in the crustacean community due to expanding bigheaded carp populations are concerning."

One deterrent strategy that shows promise is elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in water which can alter the behavior of freshwater fishes, including invasive bigheaded carps (Hypophthalmichthys spp.). However, few studies have evaluated behavioral responses to elevated CO2 concentrations at different water temperatures. The objective of this study was to quantify CO2 concentrations needed to achieve avoidance (voluntary response) and narcosis (involuntary response observed by loss of equilibrium) behaviors in silver carp (H. molitrix) and bighead carp (H. nobilis) at 5, 15, and 25 degrees C. Overall, silver carp and bighead carp displayed avoidance and narcosis behaviors to CO2 at each water temperature, however bighead carp responded at higher CO2 concentrations than silver carp. Behavioral avoidance and narcosis were observed at approximately 40% lower CO2 concentrations in 5 degrees C water relative to 25 degrees C suggesting considerable influence of water temperature on a CO2 stimulus for both species. Results indicate that fluctuating water temperature (e.g., spatial and temporal variation across management sites) can influence how fish respond to elevated CO2, and may usefully be considered when applying CO2 as a behavioral deterrent."

Although habitat fragmentation may be detrimental to native fish species, it might act as an effective and economical barrier for controlling the spread of invasive species in riverine systems. Various technologies have been proposed as potential fish deterrents at locks and dams to reduce bigheaded carp (i.e., silver carp and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys spp.)) range expansion in the Upper Mississippi River (UMR). Lock and Dam (LD) 15 is infrequently at open-river condition (spillway gates completely open; hydraulic head across the dam <0.4 m) and has been identified as a potential location for fish deterrent implementation. We used acoustic telemetry to evaluate paddlefish passage at UMR dams and to evaluate seasonal and diel movement of paddlefish and bigheaded carp relative to environmental conditions and lock operations at LD 15. We observed successful paddlefish passage at all dams, with the highest number of passages occurring at LDs 17 and 16. Paddlefish residency events in the downstream lock approach of LD 15 occurred more frequently and for longer durations than residency events of bigheaded carp. We documented upstream passages completed by two individual paddlefish through the lock chamber at LD 15, and a single bighead carp completed upstream passage through the lock chamber during two separate years of this study. We identified four bigheaded carp and 19 paddlefish that made upstream passages through the spillway gates at LD 15 during this study. The majority of the upstream passages through the spillway gates for both species occurred during open river conditions. When hydraulic head was approximately 1-m or greater, we observed these taxa opt for upstream passage through the lock chamber more often than the dam gates. In years with infrequent open-river condition, a deterrent placed in the downstream lock approach may assist in meeting the management goal of reducing upstream passage of bigheaded carps but could also potentially affect paddlefish residency and passage. Continued study to understand the effects of deterrents on native fish could be beneficial for implementing an integrated bigheaded carp control strategy. Understanding fish behavior at UMR dams is a critical information need for river managers as they evaluate potential tools or technologies to control upstream expansion of bigheaded carp in the UMR."

Main stem navigation dams on the upper Mississippi River, long considered a deterrent to fish migration, may slow or prevent the spread of invasive fish species. As discharge increases, hydraulic head (i.e., difference between upstream elevation and downstream elevation) at these navigation dams decreases, which is believed to allow for easier fish passage. We used acoustic telemetry to investigate the occurrence, frequency, and timing of bigheaded carp passage of upper Mississippi River dams, along with factors related to successful dam passage. During 2013 through 2017, adult silver carp (H. molitrix), bighead carp (H. nobilis) and their hybrids (N = 358) were tracked throughout the upper Mississippi River. A total of 1078 dam passages by bigheaded carps (N = 158) were observed past 15 dams. Seventy-eight percent of dam passages occurred during April through July. Cox proportional hazards regression models indicated that both upstream and downstream dam passages by these species were strongly affected by hydraulic head height at the dam and water temperature, with dam passages increasing as hydraulic head decreased and water temperature increased. A few dams rarely experience low hydraulic head and passages of those dams by bigheaded carps were rare. This information can be used by managers to develop strategies (e.g., placement of deterrent technologies, targeted removal efforts) to slow the spread of these invasive species."

Controlling bigheaded carp is a priority of fisheries managers and one area of focus involves developing acoustic deterrents to prevent upstream migration. For an acoustic deterrent to be effective however, the hearing ability of bigheaded carp must be characterized. A previous study showed that bigheaded carp detected sound up to 3 kHz but this range is narrower than what has been reported for other ostariophysans. Therefore, silver and bighead carp frequency detection was evaluated in response to 100 Hz to 9 kHz using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). AEPs were recorded from 100 Hz to 5 kHz. The lowest thresholds were at 500 Hz for both species (silver carp threshold: 80.6 +/- 3.29 dB re 1 mu Pa SPLrms, bighead carp threshold: 90.5 +/- 5.75 dB re 1 mu Pa SPLrms; mean +/- SD). These results provide fisheries managers with better insight on effective acoustic stimuli for deterrent systems, however, to fully determine bigheaded carp hearing abilities, these results need to be compared with behavioral assessments."

This study examined the phonotaxic response of the bighead carp (H. nobilis) to pure tones (500-2000 Hz) and playbacks of broadband sound from an underwater recording of a 100 hp outboard motor (0.06-10 kHz) in an outdoor concrete pond (10 x 5 x 1.2 m) at the U.S. Geological Survey Upper Midwest Environmental Science Center in La Crosse, WI. The number of consecutive times the fish reacted to sound from alternating locations at each end of the pond was assessed. Bighead carp were relatively indifferent to the pure tones with median consecutive responses ranging from 0 to 2 reactions away from the sound source. However, fish consistently exhibited significantly (P < 0.001) greater negative phonotaxis to the broadband sound (outboard motor recording) with an overall median response of 20 consecutive reactions during the 10 min trials. In over 50% of broadband sound tests, carp were still reacting to the stimulus at the end of the trial, implying that fish were not habituating to the sound. This study suggests that broadband sound may be an effective deterrent to bighead carp and provides a basis for conducting studies with wild fish.

To optimize potential optical deterrents, it is necessary to understand the visual sensitivity of the fishes. Dark-adapted H. molitrix and H. nobilis were found to possess broad visual sensitivity between 470 to 620 nm with peak spectral sensitivity at 540 nm for H. molitrix and 560 nm in H. nobilis. To assess the effect of a strobe light on vision, dark-adapted H. molitrix, H. nobilis and common carp Cyprinus carpio, were exposed to three different 5 s trains (100, 200, or 500 ms on-off flashes) of white light and the recovery of visual sensitivity was determined by measuring the b-wave amplitude of the electroretinogram (ERG). For all species, the longest recoveries were observed in response to the 500 ms flash trains (H. molitrix mean +/- SE = 702.0 +/- 89.8 s; H. nobilis 648.0 +/- 116.0 s; C. carpio 480 +/- 180.0 s). The results suggest that strobe lights can temporarily depress visual sensitivity, which may render optical barriers less effective."

Biodiversity & Conservation"	"Expansion of non-native fish have caused ecological and economic damage and can negatively impact native fish populations. Current research on deterrent technologies for bighead Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and silver carp H. molitrix have primarily focused on reducing upstream movement in large river lock approaches. However, there is also interest in excluding carp from smaller-scale locations. A water control structure at Emiquon Preserve, Lewistown, Illinois, USA reconnected the Preserve's wetland lakes to the Illinois River, and is a pinch point that site managers seek to deter immigration of non-native fishes without restricting native fish movement. One possible deterrent strategy that was evaluated within the water control structure in 2017 was the use of a 100 hp boat motor acoustic stimulus. Two underwater speakers were installed in each of two culverts to discourage fish movement though the water control structure. Fish passage was monitored using a series of passive integrated transponder (PIT) antennas in a confined study area. A combination of 176 fish consisting of seven different species (native and nonnative) were implanted with PIT tags and relocated downstream of the water control structure. Over 2 days of periodic playback of the acoustic stimulus, 29% of tagged silver carp that were detected crossed though the active underwater speaker array. The acoustic treatment did not significantly reduce silver carp or native centrarchid passage through the culverts. However, numerous silver carp were observed jumping out of the acoustically active culvert at the onset of the stimulus. The acoustic stimulus, especially the frequencies to which silver carp are most sensitive to (< 2000 Hz), rapidly attenuated in the water control structure (water depth 0.55-0.38 m). Depth related attenuation observed in and around the water control structure may have reduced the efficacy of the acoustic fish deterrent system at this location."

Results indicate that except for bigmouth buffalo, all species displayed similar trophic niche size and trophic diversity. Bigmouth buffalo occupied a small trophic niche and had the greatest trophic overlap with silver carp (93.6%) and bighead carp (94.1%) followed by gizzard shad (91.0%). Paddlefish had a trophic niche which relied on some resources different from those used by other species, and therefore had the lowest trophic overlap with bigheaded carp and other two native fish. The trophic overlap by bigheaded carp onto native fish was typically stronger than the reverse effects from native fish. Average niche overlap between silver carp and native species was as high as 71%, greater than niche overlap between bighead carp and native fish (64%).

Evolutionary Biology"	"The genetic paradox of biological invasions is complex and multifaceted. In particular, the relative role of disparate propagule sources and genetic adaptation through postintroduction hybridization has remained largely unexplored. To add resolution to this paradox, we investigate the genetic architecture responsible for the invasion of two invasive Asian carp species, bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (H. molitrix) (bigheaded carps) that experience extensive hybridization in the Mississippi River Basin (MRB). We sequenced the genomes of bighead and silver carps (similar to 1.08G bp and similar to 1.15G bp, respectively) and their hybrids collected from the MRB. We found moderate-to-high heterozygosity in bighead (0.0021) and silver (0.0036) carps, detected significantly higher dN/dS ratios of single-copy orthologous genes in bigheaded carps versus 10 other species of fish, and identified genes in both species potentially associated with environmental adaptation and other invasion-related traits. Additionally, we observed a high genomic similarity (96.3% in all syntenic blocks) between bighead and silver carps and over 90% embryonic viability in their experimentally induced hybrids. Our results suggest intrinsic genomic features of bigheaded carps, likely associated with life history traits that presumably evolved within their native ranges, might have facilitated their initial establishment of invasion, whereas ex-situ interspecific hybridization between the carps might have promoted their range expansion. This study reveals an alternative mechanism that could resolve one of the genetic paradoxes in biological invasions and provides invaluable genomic resources for applied research involving bigheaded carps."

The lake had a macrophyte cover dominated by Vallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara with a cumulative biomass of 10,647 g/m(2) that disappeared after a major flood in 2010 and changed its ecology. Management changes in stocking strategies introduced in the post-flood period enabled the culture-based fishery to maintain viability and sustainability to combat the major ecological change in the lake.

The one-way ANOVA revealed that there were no significant difference in δ13C and δ15 N values of SPM and Cyanobacteria( P<0.05),with range from 0.1ppt to 1.5ppt in δ13C .and range from 0.3ppt to 1.6ppt in δ15 N in SPM and Cyanobacteria,indicating that SPM was the main component in Cyanobacteria bloom. The high δ15 N values( ranged from 12.8ppt to 15.8ppt) of Cyanobacteria,higher than that of phytoplankton in less polluted waters( about 2ppt-8ppt),showed that nitrogen pollution was serious in all sampling sites. There was to some extent differences in feeding habit between silver carp and bighead carp in the four sampling sites in Taihu Lake,with significant difference in trophic levels between silver carp and bighead carp in Wugui Mountain( P<0.05) and without significant differences in other three sampling sites( P<0.05),indicating that the similar food composition( primarily of Cyanobacteria) in silver carp and bighead carp during the Cyanobacteria bloom. The silver carp and bighead carp had higher trophic levels in Yueliang Bay than those in other three waters did,which probably reveals that the two species ingest small amount of zooplankton besides Cyanobacteria,as well in Yueliang Bay. But further research is required to explain the food composition specifically.

To evaluate the control effects of filter-feeding fish (silver carp and bighead carp) on cyanobacterial blooms, the changes in algal species composition along the fish intestine were analyzed by microscopic examination, chlorophyll fluorescence, high-throughput DNA sequencing and pigment ratios. The microscopic examination results showed that both silver carp and bighead carp have a certain control effect on bloom-forming cyanobacteria in spring. The digestion of silver carp in summer could still effectively remove cyanobacteria and reduce the dominance of Microcystis in the phytoplankton community, while the digestion of bighead carp seemed to have little effect on cyanobacteria. The results of the chlorophyll fluorescence method were similar to those of the microscopic analysis, which indicated that silver carp could reduce the cyanobacterial biomass in spring, while bighead carp could significantly promote the dominance of cyanobacteria (p < 0.001). High-throughput DNA sequencing showed that there were significant differences in filter-feeding plankton between silver carp and bighead carp. The midgut may be the main gathering site of intestinal microorganisms, and cyanobacterial digestion mainly occurs in the intestinal segments between the foregut and midgut. The analysis of pigment ratios indicated that selective digestion of phytoplankton by silver carp significantly reduced the dominance of Cyanophyta in its hindgut (p < 0.01), while bighead carp had the opposite effect (p < 0.05), especially in seasons other than spring. The results of the above four methods are basically the same, that is, the digestion effect of silver carp on cyanobacteria is better than that of bighead carp. Therefore, the stocking proportion of silver carp should be appropriately increased in some meso-eutrophic waterbodies."

As the world's busiest inland river in regard to shipping, little attention has been paid to underwater noise pollution. In 2017, the underwater noise level in 25 riverside locations along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River mainly at night time were investigated by using passive acoustic monitoring method. Approximately 88% and 40% of the sampled sites exhibit noise levels exceeding the underwater acoustic thresholds of causing responsiveness and temporary threshold shift, respectively, in cetacean. Noise pollution may impose a high impact on fish with physostomous swim bladders and Weberian ossicles, such as silver carp, bighead carp, goldfish and common carp, whereas it may affect fish with physoclistous swim bladders and without Weberian ossicles, such as lake sturgeon and paddlefish, to a lesser extent. Noise levels reductions of approximately 10 and 20 dB were observed in the middle and lower reaches, respectively, of the Yangtze River over the 2012 level. The green development mode of the ongoing construction of green shipping in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, including the development of green shipping lanes, ports, ships and transportation organizations, may account for the alleviated underwater noise pollution. Follow-up noise mitigation endeavors, such as the extension of ship speed restrictions and the study and implementation of the optimal navigation speed in ecologically important areas, are required to further reduce the noise level in the Yangtze River to protect local porpoises and fish."

Environmental Sciences & Ecology"	"Bighead Carp Hypothalmichthys nobilis and Silver Carp Hypothalmichthys moltrix (hereafter collectively referred to as Bigheaded Carp) have spread throughout the majority of the Mississippi River since the 1970s. The current northern invasion edge of Bigheaded Carp in the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) spans between Pools 14 and 20 because of limited passage at Lock and Dam (LD) 19. Mechanisms limiting adult Bigheaded Carp abundance above LD19 are unknown but may be due in part to lack of reproductive success influenced by adult abundance and environmental factors. Our objective was to investigate how relative adult biomass and river temperature and discharge affect maximum annual Bigheaded Carp larval production in the UMR using a Ricker stock-recruitment model. Adult Bigheaded Carp relative biomass (kg/h) was estimated annually with boat electrofishing and larvae were collected every 10 d between May and August 2014-2017 in Pools 14-20 in the UMR. Adult relative biomass ranged from 0.0 to 880.9 kg/h, whereas maximum annual larval densities ranged from 0.0 to 2,869.4 larvae/m(3). After accounting for variability among pools and years, the most supported linear Ricker stock-recruitment model indicated the number of recruits per spawner decreased with increasing adult relative biomass and increased with mean discharge. Our results highlight the importance of adult biomass and river discharge conditions for reproduction of Bigheaded Carp along leading edges of invasion. Management strategies that aim to maintain low adult abundance where reproduction is not yet occurring could help limit population increases via reproduction, whereas reducing high adult biomass (e.g., commercial harvest, barriers) may result in greater Bigheaded Carp reproductive output in the UMR."

Lock and Dam 19 (LD19) is a high-head dam on the UMR that delineates downriver areas where bigheaded carps are well established from upriver pools where these species are less abundant and evidence of reproduction and recruitment are limited. Principal natal environments supporting recruitment of emerging bigheaded carp populations in the UMR are unknown. The objectives of this study were to (1) infer environments occupied during early-life stages by bigheaded carps collected in UMR Pools 19-21 during 2013-2014 using otolith microchemistry and stable isotope analyses, and (2) use early-life environment assignments and capture location to identify individuals that passed through LD19. Differences in multivariate water chemistry signatures (Sr:Ca, Ba:Ca and O-18) among the UMR, its tributaries, and the Missouri and Middle Mississippi rivers enabled development of a classification model for inferring early-life environment of bigheaded carps. Multiple sources of recruits, including from tributaries, have contributed to upriver expansion of bigheaded carps in the UMR. Sustainable control of bigheaded carps upstream of LD19 will likely require efforts to control local recruitment and immigration from downriver. The frequency of bigheaded carps collected in Pool 19 that were downstream of LD19 during early life suggests that bigheaded carps upstream of LD19 still predominantly consisted of immigrants from downriver during 2013-2014. Otolith chemistry provides an approach for assessing the extent to which changes in abundance of bigheaded carps upstream of LD19 are associated with local recruitment or immigration from downriver."

Since these methods are a universal tool to analyze data, it is important to assess their effectiveness using long-term datasets in well-studied systems. The objectives of this study were to identify trends in the fish communities and to characterize the community trajectory (i.e., directional or nondirectional) of the Illinois River, a large tributary to the Mississippi River, using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Although NMDS has been used to evaluate community trajectory in multivariate space over time in smaller rivers, there has been less attention given to larger rivers, which may exhibit different dynamics. To evaluate changes in large river fish communities, we used a long-term electrofishing monitoring dataset (1957-2013) that includes fish abundance data from six reaches of the Illinois River, Illinois, U.S.A. Temporal changes in Illinois River fish communities were evident in NMDS ordinations. Larger changes in NMDS ordinations were associated with improving water quality conditions, whereas the invasion of bigheaded carp (silver carp Hypophthalimichtys molitrix and bighead carp H. nobilis) produced smaller and less variable changes. Across all six reaches of the Illinois River, the trajectory of fish communities was directional in multivariate space, with no return to an initial or predisturbance condition. Community trajectory in larger and more heavily-modified rivers may be substantially different and more complex than that of smaller and less heavily modified rivers."

However, social cues expressed by shoal mates is one strategy species use to assess risk. By shoaling and using social cues, fishes may identify and mimic others with anti-predator behaviors to increase their own survival. Ability of non-native fishes, such as bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis), to mimic native species that have experienced predatory threats is not known. In this experimental study, we varied the number of experienced individuals and the species composition to contrast the responses of naive juvenile bighead carp exposed to predatory kairomones when grouped with differing numbers of either experienced conspecific or experienced heterospecific (golden shiner, Notemigonus crysoleucas) shoal mates. We found fully naive groups of bighead carp did not respond to largemouth bass kairomones, but that naive individuals could mimic anti-predatory behaviors of experienced individuals, even when those experienced individuals were heterospecifics. Diverse alarm responses of bighead carp to composition and experience suggest that responses of this species are plastic. Through changing responses based on shoal experience level and composition, plastic social learning highlights how naive individuals may adapt to novel predator threats, which could inform predictions of non-native persistence in novel waterways."

Many adaptations, including chemical cues, benefit shoaling groups by informing members of a possible impending predatory threat. Bighead (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carps (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) are widely dispersed invasive fishes that spend much of their first year at a size vulnerable to predation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the fright response of juvenile bighead and silver carps when exposed to alarm cues from conspecific and heterospecific fishes. Groups of carps were exposed to 5 mL of alarm cue from either bighead carp, silver carp, golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), or fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). Behavior was recorded before and after the application of the treatment. Our results indicate that both species were unable to recognize chemical alarm cues from North American cypriniforms, yet both were able to recognize conspecific alarm cues. However, the two species of bigheaded carps respond to conspecific chemicals differently. Silver carp increase distance among individuals, whereas bighead carp reduce distance between individuals. Both show a reduction in activity after chemical application. Though both species recognize conspecific alarm cues, bighead carp exhibit similar fright patterns when exposed to alarm chemicals of silver carp, yet no behavioral responses were detected in silver carp when exposed to alarm chemicals of bighead carp. An understanding of fright response in bighead and silver carps aids understanding of predator interactions and ecological roles of these fishes, and can be utilized in population management applications."

In particular, this method is being applied by many jurisdictions surrounding the Great Lakes to monitor for the potential presence of Asian carp. We developed two multiplex quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions for the simultaneous testing for eDNA from the four species of Asian carp that have been identified as potential invaders into the Great Lakes [bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), black carp (Mylophollyngodon piceus), and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) along with internal controls to test for false positive results due to sample contamination. The assays are highly sensitive and have the ability to detect trace amounts of carp DNA in laboratory controls. The use of a multiplex design allows for simultaneous testing for numerous species, reducing processing and handling times, lowering costs and reducing the amount of DNA extract required for testing. The multiplex assays described in this study may be readily applied to Asian carp monitoring programs, and are currently being used to support surveillance efforts in the Canadian waters of Lake Erie, Lake Huron and Lake Ontario for all four species of Asian carp.

In fish farms of the North-Eastern and Eastern regions of Ukraine, 26 species of parasites were found in herbivorous fish: 19 species in the silver carp (11 — protozoa, 1 — monogeneans, 4 — trematodes, 3 — parasitic crustaceans); 18 species in the grass carp (6 — protozoa, 1 — monogeneans, 4 — trematodes, 4 — cestodes, 3 — parasitic crustaceans); and 20 species in the bighead carp (10 — protozoa, 1 — monogeneans, 4 — trematodes, 2 — cestodes, 3 — parasitic crustaceans). 11 species (42.3%) of registered parasites were invasive; 18 species (69.2%) of the detected herbivorous fish’s parasites develop directly and 8 (30.8%) — with the participation of definitive and intermediate hosts; the fish is an additional (second intermediate) host in the life cycle of 6 species (23.1%) of parasites. Outbreaks of diseases caused by parasitic protozoa from the genera Myxobolus, Cryptobia, Chilodonella, and Ichthyophthirius have been reported in both fingerlings and two-year-olds. The protozoa from the genera Ichthyobodo, Trichodina, and Trichodinella were registered en masse only in fingerlings. Pathogens from the genus Dactylogyrus were more often registered among three-year-old silver and bighead carps. Metacercariae of Ichthyocotylurus variegatus were found en masse in fingerlings of the grass carp. Posthodiplostomum cuticola larvae in unfavorable farms were found with a high level of prevalence in fish of different age groups. Thong plerocercoids were more commonly recorded in two-year-old silver and bighead carps and fingerlings of the grass carp. The highest level of cestode infection with Bothriocephalus acheilognathi was recorded in fingerlings of the grass carp. Parasitic crustaceans Sinergasilus lieni with a high level of prevalence were registered in two-year-old and three-year-old fish. Crustaceans Lernaea cyprinacea massively affected two-year-old and three-year-old fish. Pathogens from the genera Trichodina, Cryptobia, and Chilodonella, and Dactylogyrus hypophthalmichthys, Posthodiplostomum cuticola, and Sinergasilus lieni were of the greatest epizootic significance for the silver carp; for the bighead carp — from the genus Myxobolus, (especially M. pavlovskii), Chilodonella piscicola, Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, Dactylogyrus aristichthys, Posthodiplostomum cuticola, Diplostomum spathaceum, Digramma interrupta, and Sinergasilus lieni; for the grass carp — Bothriocephalus acheilognathi, Ichthyocotylurus variegatus, Ligula intestinalis, Sinergasilus major, Lernaea cyprinacea, Ichthyobodo necator, and Ichthyophthirius multifiliis"	"10.36016/jvmbbs-2020-6-1-4"	"internal-pdf://1483229224/pJVMBBS_2020061_018-024.pdf"

The Japanese smelt (Hypomesus nipponensis) invaded and has become a dominant fish species in Lake Erhai, a highland lake in southwestern China, since 2016. Here, we engineered Ecopath models for two different periods, 2008-2009 (preinvasion) and 2016-2018 (postinvasion), in Lake Erhai to model ecosystem impacts from the Japanese smelt invasion. In the dynamic Ecosim model based on the 2016-2018 Ecopath model, we ran three 50-year scenarios to simulate the potential effects of Japanese smelts on the system. Our results showed competition between invasive and native species as well as changes in trophic structures, highlighting the impacts of the invasive species over time. The lake ecosystem additionally experienced significant degradation after invasion, mainly reflected in several related indicators, such as total biomass/total system throughput (TB/TST), total primary production/total biomass (TPP/TB), total primary production/total respiration (TPP/TR), Finn's mean path length (FML), Finn's cycling index (FCI) and the Connectance Index (CI). The simulation results indicated that the relative biomass of icefish (Neosalanx taihuensis), bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis), sharpbelly (Hemiculter leucisculus), and zooplankton were significantly affected by increasing the strength of the top-down control of the Japanese smelt on its prey. It is also important to do ecological regulation of planktivorous fishes in the studied Lake Erhai, especially the Japanese smelt."

In order to investigate the environmental impacts of faeces from channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis), certain biophysical characteristics during faecal sinking at three temperatures (10, 20 and 30 degrees C for winter, spring-autumn and summer conditions, respectively) were assessed in the present study. Settling velocities of faeces from channel catfish (1.72-13.33 cm/s) and bighead carp (4.16-13.83 cm/s) accelerated with an increase in water temperature. For channel catfish faeces, there were positive correlations between settling velocity and physical properties, i.e., weight, volume, length and diameter; however, for bighead carp faeces, no linear relationship between settling velocity and length was found. The main faecal water absorption period for these two species occurred after 2.5 min of immersion. The main leaching period of faecal carbon and nitrogen was 0-2.5 min, and the leaching period of faecal phosphorus was 0-10 min. The nutrient contents in channel catfish faeces were significantly higher than those in bighead carp faeces. These results suggest that co-culturing channel catfish with bighead carp can effectively reduce the discharge of nutrients from aquaculture. The biophysical properties of these two types of fish faeces can also provide guidance in particle waste collection."	"10.3390/su14127201"	"internal-pdf://1363772588/sustainability-14-07201-v3.pdf"

Species composition and body size spectrum of zooplankton assemblage are sensitive to the changes of physico-chemical variability and fish feeding stress, and thus have in turn a prime bearing on water quality and cultured fishes. To study the response of zooplankton community to the introduction of planktivorous carps, monthly surveys were conducted in 2015 at six traditionally monitored locations in Miyun Reservoir, the unique surface drinking water of Beijing. There was a decrease in species richness, diversity, density and biomass, suggesting simplification of the community structure. Species diversity, density, and biomass declined significantly through the growth season, illustrating the great pressure imposed on the zooplankton. Regression and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed low relationships between community traits and environmental variables. Zooplankton biomass had a significantly negative relationship with the stocking intensity of the filter-feeding carp. The different responses of the subgroups of Protozoa, Rotifera, Cladocera and Copepoda indicated that they responded differently to environmental stress. Seasonal variations in the density and biomass of the four subgroups and biomass size spectrum (BSS) indicated that planktons with medium and large body sizes were more sensitive and suffered more stress from the filter-feeding carp. The filter feeding by the silver and bighead carp disrupted the natural equilibrium of the zooplankton community, decreased diversity and stocks, altered the seasonal dynamics of all quantitative traits and suppressed the dominance of medium- and large-sized species or functional groups. The impacts of the fishery mode and the responses of different functional groups of zooplankton must be considered in ecological assessments and biomanipulation studies based on the zooplankton community structure and dynamics."

This study was conducted for two years. The polyculture ponds of grass carp, crucian carp and bighead carp were grouped into the treatment group using the zero-water exchange mode, while the ordinary polyculture ponds of grass carp, bighead carp, and crucian carp were grouped into the control group. The results showed that 1) the treatment group reduced water conductivity, dissolved solids and sediment organic carbon significantly (P < 0.05), and improved water transparency significantly (P < 0.05); 2) the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus accumulation amount and rate in the water of the treatment group were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than those in the control group, so was the sediment accumulation rate of organic carbon and nitrogen (P < 0.05); 3) the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus utilization efficiency of stocked fish in the treatment group were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those in the control group, with an increase of 29.49%, 21.72%, and 20.65%, respectively. Therefore, the zero-water ex-change pond was a green and efficient aquaculture mode, which could improve water quality, reduce nutrient accumulation, and improve the utilization efficiency of nutrients effectively.

However, the quantity of bighead carp and its effect on water quality and plankton community have been the focus of debate among ecologists. Herein, in order to more accurately simulate the environmental conditions of lakes, we selected earthen ponds with large areas adjacent to Lake Qiandao from May to August in 2016 to study the responses of water quality condition and plankton community to a gradient of bighead carp stocked alone. Experimental groups with different densities of carp stocked were set as follows: 12.1 (LF), 23.5 (MF), and 32.5 g/m(3) (HF), and a control group with no fish (NF). Results showed that total phosphorus (TP) in the fish-containing groups considerably decreased, and the lowest chlorophyll-a concentration (chl-a) was detected in the MF group. The biomass accumulation of the crustacean zooplankton was suppressed after carp was introduced, but the diversity, richness, and evenness of the crustacean zooplankton were weakly affected, except in the HF group. Phytoplankton biomass especially that of cyanobacteria was grazed rapidly by fish in the MF and HF groups and biodiversity indices were considerably increased in the fish-containing groups, especially in the late stages of the experiment. At a fish stocking density of 23.5-38.8 g/m(3), the highest efficiency in controlling cyanobacteria and promoting water condition was achieved, and the impact on zooplankton diversity was weak. Our results indicated that bighead carp can be included in the EAR of lakes and reservoirs, but the optimal density of bighead carp stocking should be carefully considered."

The outcomes revealed that the overall ammonia nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, total inorganic nitrogen, and orthophosphate concentrations in every one of the carbon source treatments were significantly less (P < 0.05) than the control. The net production of silver carp and bighead carp in the molasses treatment was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that in the control. The total feed conversion rates of the fish in the molasses and the mixed carbon source treatments were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than in the control, while the total protein efficiency ratio values in the corn starch, molasses, and mixed carbon source treatments were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those in the control. The bioflocs significantly (P < 0.05) impacted the muscle makeup of crude protein, crude fat, and ash of mirror carp. The current examination showed that the increased generation and feed used in mirror, silver, and bighead carp may be reached with an enhanced water grade when different carbon sources were added, while the use of molasses, an organic carbon source, was optimal compared to the other carbon sources due to its low price and good effect."

For this purpose, three bioflocs treatments with carbohydrate referred to as 'BFT-24% (24% feed protein)', 'BFT-27% (27% feed protein)' and 'BFT-30% (30% feed protein)' and a control referred to as 'CW-30% (30% feed protein)' without carbohydrate addition were performed in three replicate enclosures (7 m x 7 m x 1.5 m) each. Young bottom feeder mirror carp (Cyprinus carpio specularis) and filter feeder bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) with initial mean individual body weights of 691.34 ( +/- 6.73 g) and 327.13 ( +/- 3.54 g), respectively, were stocked altogether in polyculture at biomass of 800 gm(-2) and 200 gm(-2) in the control and treatment enclosures. There was a significant positive correlation between the bioflocs volumes and water temperatures from 19.3-28.5 degrees C (P < 0.05). The pH values and the concentrations of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), nitrite nitrogen (NO2-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) and orthophosphate (PO4-P) in all the treatments of BFT were significantly lower than those in the control (P < 0.05), while the total alkalinity, the concentration of chlorophyll a and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) did not show significant differences among the treatments and the control (P < 0.05), while the digestive enzyme activity in the BFT treatments did not show significant differences compared with that in the control (P > 0.05). This study demonstrated that a protein-restricted diet did not affect the productive performance or body condition index of mirror carp and bighead carp in a BFT polyculture system with improved water quality."

The results showed that blood lactate and serum glucose increased significantly under hypoxia stress, and some differentially expressed genes were identified among hypoxia tolerant, hypoxia sensitive, and normoxia control groups. Differentially expressed genes between hypoxia tolerant and hypoxia sensitive groups were mainly involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, insulin signaling, apoptosis, tight junction, and adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes pathways, of which MAPK signaling pathway played a key role in cardiac tolerance to hypoxia in bighead carp. These results provide a basis for understanding the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxia response in fish and a guide for future genetic breeding programs for hypoxia resistance in bighead carp. As aquatic animals, fishes often encounter various situations of low oxygen, and they have evolved the ability to respond to hypoxia stress. Studies of physiological and molecular responses to hypoxia stress are essential to clarify genetic mechanisms underlying hypoxia tolerance in fish. In this study, we performed acute hypoxia treatment in juvenile bighead carp (Hypophthalmicthys nobilis) by decreasing water O(2)from 6.5 mg/L to 0.5 mg/L in three hours. This hypoxia stress resulted in a significant increase in blood lactate and serum glucose. Comparisons of heart transcriptome among hypoxia tolerant (HT), hypoxia sensitive (HS), and normoxia control (NC) groups showed that 820, 273, and 301 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in HS vs. HT, NC vs. HS, and NC vs. HT (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.01, Fold Change> 2), respectively. KEGG pathway enrichment showed that DEGs between HS and HT groups were mainly involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, insulin signaling, apoptosis, tight junction and adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes pathways, and DEGs in MAPK signaling pathway played a key role in cardiac tolerance to hypoxia. Combined with the results of our previous cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) analysis of hypoxia stress in this species, such genes asstbp2,ttn,mapk,kcnh, andtnfrsfwere identified in both studies, representing the significance of these DEGs in hypoxia tolerance in bighead carp. These results provide insights into the understanding of genetic modulations for fish heart coping with hypoxia stress and generate basic resources for future breeding studies of hypoxia resistance in bighead carp."

Evolutionary Biology"	"Gut microbiomes play an essential role in host survival and local adaptation and thus can facilitate the invasion of host species. Biological invasions have been shown to be linked to the genetic properties of alien host species. It is thus plausible that the holobiont, the host, and its associated microbiome act as an entity to drive invasion success. The bighead carp and silver carp (bigheaded carps), invasive species that exhibit extensive hybridization in the Mississippi River Basin (MRB), provided a unique model to test the holobiont hypothesis of invasion. Here, we investigated the microbiomes of foreguts and hindguts in bigheaded carps and their reciprocal hybrids reared in aquaculture ponds using 16S amplicons and the associated gene prediction. We found an admixed pattern in the gut microbiome community in bigheaded carp hybrids. The hybrid gut microbiomes showed special characteristics such as relatively high alpha diversity in the foregut, an increasing dissimilarity between foreguts and hindguts, and a remarkable proportion of genes coding for putative enzymes related to their digestion of main food resources (Cyanobacteria, cellulose, and chitin). The pond-reared hybrids had advantageous features in genes coding for putative enzymes related to their diet. The above results collectively suggested that the gut microbiomes of hybrids could be beneficial to their local adaptation (e.g., food resource utilization), which might have facilitated their invasion in the MRB. The gut microbial findings, along with the intrinsic genomic features likely associated with life-history traits revealed in our recent study, provide preliminary evidence supporting the holobiont hypothesis of invasion."

In a dark featureless square enclosure, groups of 3 fish were tracked and the distance of each fish from speakers and their swimming trajectories relative to sound pressure and particle acceleration were analyzed before, and then while an outboard motor sound was played. All three species exhibited negative phonotaxis during the first two exposures after which they ceased responding. The median percent time fish spent near the active speaker for the first two trials decreased from 7.0% to 1.3% for silver carp, 7.9% to 1.1% for bighead carp, and 9.5% to 3% for common carp. Notably, when close to the active speaker fish swam away from the source and maintained a nearly perfect 0 degrees orientation to the axes of particle acceleration. Fish did not enter sound fields greater than 140 dB (ref. 1 mu Pa). These results demonstrate that carp avoid complex sounds in darkness and while initial responses may be informed by sound pressure, sustained oriented avoidance behavior is likely mediated by particle motion. This understanding of how invasive carp use particle motion to guide avoidance could be used to design new acoustic deterrents to divert them in dark, turbid river waters."

Mississippi River"	"Invasive bigheaded carp are advancing up the Upper Mississippi River by passing through its locks-and-dams (LDs). Although these structures already impede fish passage, this role could be greatly enhanced by modifying how their spillway gates operate, adding deterrent systems to their locks, and removing carp. This study examined this possibility using numeric modeling and empirical data, which evaluated all three options on an annual basis in both single LDs and pairs under different river flow conditions. Over 100 scenarios were modeled. While all three approaches showed promise, ranging from 8% to 73% reductions in how many carp pass a single LD, when employed together at pairs of LDs, upstream movement rates of invasive carp could be reduced 98–99% from current levels. Although modifying spillway gate operation is the least expensive option, its efficacy drops at high flows, so lock deterrents and/or removal using fishing/trapping are required to move towards complete blockage. Improved deterrent efficacy could also offset the need for more efficient removal. This model could help prioritize research and management actions for containing carp."

Environmental Sciences & Ecology"	"The ability of fish to swim upstream through regions of swiftly flowing water is ultimately dependent on their physiological capacity. Swimming performance, the relationship between swim speed and time-to-fatigue, has been used to design fishways and identify barriers to fish movement. However, existing numerical models do not all capture the variability in swimming abilities nor the turbulent, unsteady, and three-dimensional aspect of natural flows. This deficiency is particularly problematic for fish species whose behavior is poorly understood (i.e., invasive fish) and at sites with complex flow patterns. Here, we combine species-specific swimming performance with high resolution abstractions of fluid flow in a new agent-based framework to model fatigue of upstream swimming fish under turbulent flow conditions. Our model simulates fish paths, in the absence of information on their behavioral tendencies, based on a rules-set aimed at fish swimming as far upstream as possible before complete exhaustion by selecting the path of least fatigue. We demonstrate how this model functions by examining theoretical passage of invasive silver carp, Hypopthalmichthys molitrix, and bighead carp, H. nobilis, as well a native fish, the lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, through a typical Mississippi River lock-and-dam (Lock-and-Dam #8 near Genoa, WI). The model then tests whether passage could be reduced by altering spillway gate operations. Model results suggest that passage of all three species is low under current gate operations and that passage of both carp species could be further reduced by about half through minor changes in spillway gate operation without apparent impacts on navigation, scour, or lake sturgeon passage. Model results are qualitatively consistent with observed passage rates monitored by other studies at similar lock-and-dams and are consistent with the possibility that the model likely overestimates passage rates by relying on physiological data only. This approach could be exported to other applications and fish species to help manage and control fish migration and dispersal, especially for fish whose behavior and ecology are poorly understood and not presently quantifiable."
