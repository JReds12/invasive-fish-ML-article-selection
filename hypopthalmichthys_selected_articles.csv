"Aldridge, C. A., and E. C. Boone",2022,Simple models to quickly estimate the probable range of data‐limited riverine fishes: Research & management,River Research and Applications,38,6,1154-1166,"Species distribution models provide biologists with insight into species ranges, ecological niches, and spatial predictions of suitable habitat, but require significant training, data, and time for biologists to obtain reliable results. Alternatively, ad hoc inferences from sparse occurrence records leave biologists to face conservation decisions with high uncertainty. Simple predictive models can fill the gap between these two alternatives. One method to predict the probable range of riverine fishes is to add the average distance between occurrences to the most distal occurrence (parametric estimator). However, there are drawbacks to this method when the distances between occurrences deviate from a non‐uniform distribution. Herein, estimators that are robust to non‐uniformity, a non‐parametric and an optimal linear estimator, were adapted and compared to the parametric estimator using simulations. The non‐parametric estimator showed the least bias and variance in bias for the probable range endpoint. The optimal linear estimator best balanced type I and type II errors in the maximum probable range estimate (i.e., upper CI). Application of the robust estimators were made to demonstrate how sampling can be planned based on available effort (Gulf Coast walleye, Sander vitreus) and where early detection sampling may be focused (silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). This study provides biologists with a suite of simple options (R code provided as supplementary material) to bridge the gap between ad hoc inference and complex modeling over a range of scenarios. Future studies should focus on accounting for false‐positives, variable effort, and develop online apps for accessibility.",yes

Taheri-Garavand",2020,Deep learning-based appearance features extraction for automated carp species identification,Aquacultural Engineering,89,,,"Fish species identification is vital for aquaculture and fishery industries, stock management of water bodies and environmental monitoring of aquatics. Traditional fish species identification approaches are costly, time consuming, expert-based and unsuitable for large-scale applications. Hence, in this study, a deep learning neural network as a smart, real-time and non-destructive method was developed and applied to automate the identification of four economically important carp species namely common carp (Cyprinus carpio), grass carp (Ctenopharingodon idella), bighead carp (Hypophtalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). The obtained results proved that our approach, evaluated through 5-fold cross-validation, achieved the highest possible accuracy of 100 %. The achieved high level of classification accuracy was due to the ability of the suggested deep model to build a hierarchy of self-learned features, which was in accordance with the hierarchy of these fish's identification keys. In conclusion, the proposed convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method has a single and generic trained architecture with promising performance for fish species identification.",yes

Lodge",2021,Environmental conditions influence edna particle size distribution in aquatic systems,Environmental DNA,3,3,643-653,"Knowledge about the size of environmental DNA (eDNA) and eDNA‐bearing particles in aquatic environments is integral to efficient and sensitive analyses. To explore the influence of environmental factors on eDNA particle size distribution (PSD), we manipulated fish communities across nine experimental ponds, which led to differences in a suite of environmental covariates (biochemical oxygen demand, chlorophyll a concentration, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, and turbidity) over 5 months. At the end of the experiment, we serially filtered water samples from each pond through 5 filter sizes (20, 10, 5, 1, and 0.2 µm) followed by eDNA precipitation. We used quantitative PCR to determine the proportion of Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) or bigheaded carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and H. nobilis) eDNA captured within each size fraction. Based on eDNA concentrations recorded at each size fraction, we parameterized a Weibull distribution to describe the eDNA PSD of each species in each pond. Likelihood ratio tests suggested that PSD did not differ between species but did differ across ponds. Stepwise multiple regressions indicated that the specific environmental factors with the greatest influence on PSD differed depending on the pore size of the filter used for capture. Notably, positive associations with chlorophyll and turbidity were most important for predicting capture with a 10‐µm filter, suggesting that eDNA is sticky, and the presence of relatively large particles such as algal cells or other suspended sediments can dramatically alter eDNA PSD. Therefore, we advocate that researchers and managers consider analysis of eDNA PSD within their study systems to optimize eDNA capture efficiencies and increase detection probabilities across variable biotic and abiotic conditions. Furthermore, reporting eDNA PSD evaluations across more diverse systems has the potential to reveal broader patterns of eDNA capture efficiency and improve research and natural resource management with eDNA applications.",yes

It was associated with mortality of Silver Carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, which is the most widely cultivable fish species in fresh water aquaculture. The P. shigelloides was identified based on the biochemical and molecular characterization and the pathogenicity was studied on H. molitrix. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of the present isolate (NCBI GenBank Accession Number- KX986915) revealed that, the isolate was 100% identical with P. shigelloides (NCBI GenBank Accession Number- MF100995). P. shigelloides killed 10-100% fish in experimental infection and the LD50 value was calculated as 1.3 x 10(5)CFU per fish with intraperitoneal injection. The challenged fish had subcutaneous haemorrhagic ulcers and reddening at injection sites, however there was no clinical sign observed in the gill. The histology of experimentally challenged H. molitrix showed the kidney alterations and exhibited shrinkage of epithelial cells in renal tubule and enlargement of glomerular cells.Liver showed focal accumulation of edematous fluid, necrosis and infiltration of heterophils indicative of bacterial infection. The pathology and pathogenesis studies of this pathogen in inland open waters like wetlands and lakes would help in management of the outbreak of disease in these aquatic ecosystems.",yes

Erickson",2020,Using markov chains to quantitatively assess movement patterns of invasive fishes impacted by a carbon dioxide barrier in outdoor ponds,Natural Resource Modeling,33,4,,"Natural resource managers use barriers to deter the movement of aquatic invasive species. Research and development of new invasive species barriers is often evaluated in pond and field scales using high-resolution telemetry data. Telemetry data sets can be a rich source of data about fish movement and behavior but can be difficult to analyze due to the size of these data sets as well as their irregular sampling intervals. Due to the challenges, most barrier studies only use summary endpoints, such as barrier passage counts or average (e.g., mean or median) fish distance from the barrier, to describe the data. To examine more fine-scale fish movement patterns, we developed a first-order Markov chain. We then used this model to help understand the impacts of a barrier on fish behavior. For our study system, we used data from a previous study examining how bighead and silver carp (two invasive fish species in the United States) responded to a carbon dioxide (CO2) barrier in a pond. Considerations for management Based upon our findings, management considerations include: Markov chains can be used to describe and quantify movement patterns of aquatic organisms responding to barriers. These models provide insight not possible with previously used summary approaches. The CO(2)barrier changed both the locations of fish and movement patterns of fish. The changes in movement were not captured using conventional endpoints. Specifically, fish had less random movement patterns during periods of CO(2)exposure. This provides evidence that bighead and silver carp actively avoided areas with CO(2)and also shows that our approach can help assess random versus nonrandom movements",yes

Garvey",2017,A refined electrofishing technique for collecting silver carp: Implications for management,North American Journal of Fisheries Management,37,1,101-107,"Detecting nuisance species at low abundance or in newly established areas is critical to developing pest management strategies. Due to their sensitivity to disturbance and erratic jumping behavior, Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix can be difficult to collect with traditional sampling methods. We compared catch per unit effort (CPUE) of all species froma Long Term Resource Monitoring (LTRM) electrofishing protocol to an experimental electrofishing technique designed to minimize Silver Carp evasion through tactical boat maneuvering and selective application of power. Differences in CPUE between electrofishing methods were detected for 2 of 41 species collected across 2 years of sampling at 20 sites along the Illinois River. The mean catch rate of Silver Carp using the experimental technique was 2.2 times the mean catch rate of the LTRM electrofishing technique; the increased capture efficiency at low relative abundance emphasizes the utility of this method for early detection. The experimental electrofishing also collected slightly larger Silver Carp (mean: 510.7 mm TL versus 495.2 mm TL), and nearly four times as many Silver Carp independently jumped into the boat during experimental transects. Novel sampling approaches, such as the experimental electrofishing technique used in this study, should be considered to increase probability of detection for aquatic nuisance species.",yes

In the forty years before 2009, cyanobacteria frequently bloomed in WY Lake, an event which has not occurred since 2009. The stocking density of filter-feeding carp was estimated to be more than 50 g/m3 in July after 2009, approximately double the amount observed before 2009, and the ratio of silver carp to bighead carp (SBR) increased from 0.8 to more than 1.6. Compared with the water quality between 2004 and 2007, the total nitrogen (TN) and the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration decreased while total phosphorus (TP) and transparency (SD) increased significantly after 2009 (P < 0.05). The decreasing Chl-a concentration was observed in Jul, Jun, May, Jul, and Mar in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2016, and 2017, respectively. The Chl-a concentration was significantly negatively correlated with TP (P < 0.05), and no significant correlation with TN was observed (P > 0.05). A significant negative correlation was observed between fish yield and SD (P < 0.05). The results also showed that filter-feeding carp more effectively restrained algae growth when SD was low. These results indicated that a high density of filter-feeding fish with increased SBR interfered with the driving effects of nutrients and temperature on the growth of algal biomass and then restrained bloom of algae. It may be necessary to take SD into consideration for determining the appropriate fish stocking density for the biomanipulation of algae.",yes
"Chara-Serna, A. M., and A. Casper",2021,How do large river zooplankton communities respond to abiotic and biotic drivers over time? A complex and spatially dependent example,Freshwater Biology,66,2,391-405,"Recent evidence shows that in lotic, physically-dominated ecosystems like large rivers, zooplankton can develop spatially structured assemblages and fulfill functionally important roles. While refuting the long-standing notion that riverine zooplankton communities are numerically depauperate and spatially homogeneous, this also shows that the importance of abiotic and biotic drivers and the consistency of ecological patterns are still poorly understood for these communities. We collected zooplankton along 300 km of the Illinois River for 5 years to test the influence of a suite of biotic and abiotic variables on zooplankton density, biomass, and diversity. We hypothesized abiotic variables such as temperature, turbidity, and velocity would be predominant predictors, with biotic variables like planktivory becoming important when physical factors do not constrain them. Results showed basin-wide declines in zooplankton taxonomic richness as planktivory from the invading silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) increased. In contrast, density and biomass were explained by abiotic factors at the basin scale, with velocity, turbidity, and pH driving biomass and velocity driving density. We also found that both the driving factors and the plankton responses varied among the upper, middle, and lower sections of the Illinois River. We conclude that while zooplankton communities of the Illinois River are highly structured in space, the driving forces behind their distribution patterns are not simple. Instead, there is a complex spatio-temporal template of biological, chemical, and hydraulic factors shaping these communities in the Illinois River. Along with emphasizing the importance of spatial heterogeneity in large river ecosystems, these results also support a growing view that invasive species interactions can supersede the well-established role of abiotic factors in explaining global freshwater diversity losses. This also highlights the importance of including long-term zooplankton sampling in ecological monitoring programs in diverse and productive large river systems like the Illinois.",yes

We captured over 12,700 individual fishes including eight taxa, over 12,000 of which (> 95%) were larval silver carp between 5 and 21 mm standard length. Peak catch rates occurred near the confluence of the Illinois and Mississippi rivers. These findings suggest that larval silver carp have an affinity for edge of the flood habitat and further study is needed to better understand how this affects the dynamics of this invasive species in the Mississippi River. The high catch rates observed at the confluence of the Illinois and Mississippi rivers suggests that the Illinois River is an important source of larval silver carp to the Upper Mississippi River.",yes

The invasion of silver carp in the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS) provides a unique opportunity to assess the influence of this invasive species on native fishes because a highly standardized, long-term monitoring program has been sampling the fish communities in six reaches of the UMRS for over 20 years. We analyzed fish abundance (catch per unit effort from electrofishing) and water-quality data collected from 1994 to 2013 from three reaches where silver carp populations have been established since 2000, and three reaches where they are not established. Our results provide empirical evidence of a negative effect of invasive silver carp on native sport fish in the UMRS. Although water temperature, suspended solid concentration, and flooding also differed substantially between control and invaded reaches, only silver carp abundance had a direct negative relationship with the abundance of adult sport fish. Our analyses suggest that the mechanism for this decline may be competition for zooplankton between silver carp and larval/juvenile sport fish. In reaches where silver carp is established, recruitment of juvenile sport fish appears to be constrained relative to reaches where silver carp is not established.",yes

This ability drives their efficient consumption of phytoplankton and because they feed low on the food chain they have an important place in aquaculture worldwide. In North America, where they are considered invasive, silver carp deplete food resources for native species and in so doing occupy increased niche space. Here, we determine the ontogenetic stage and size at which silver carp are morphologically capable of primarily feeding on particles <10 mu m. Ecological studies on this species have shown that there is an ontogenetic shift in diet as predominantly zooplanktivorous juveniles later switch to eating much smaller phytoplankton. The occupation of this new trophic niche presents both a metabolic and a mechanical challenge to these fish, since it is unclear how they can efficiently feed on such small particles. We hypothesize that the epibranchial organ (EBO) in silver carp is essential in aggregating these small particles of food, allowing the species to consume mass quantities of tiny particles, thus mitigating metabolic constraints. In this study, we investigate early ontogeny of the EBO in silver carp to determine when this structure achieves the requisite morphology to become functional. We find that at around 80 mm standard length (SL) the EBOs are consistently filled with food, demonstrating that this accumulating organ has become functional. This size corresponds with previous ecological data documenting important shifts in the type of food consumed. While the basic bauplan of the EBO is established very early in ontogeny (by 15 mm SL), multiple waves of histological maturation of muscle, cartilage, gill rakers and epithelium ultimately form the functional structure.",yes

Its complex trophic anatomy may help explain the apparent efficiency with which they consume phytoplankton, outcompeting native filter feeders. This cypriniform species is characterized by trophic synapomorphies that include a palatal organ, loss of upper pharyngeal jaws, and a hypertrophied lower pharyngeal jaw. However, in silver carp these structures have become greatly modified and diverge from the more basal condition that characterizes species such as goldfish. The trophic apparatus of silver carp is composed of discrete structures that are functionally coupled: filtering plates, paired epibranchial organs (EBO), a modified palatal organ composed of large muscular folds that interdigitate with the filtering plates, and hypertrophied lower pharyngeal jaws and teeth. The filtering plates fill a significant portion of the buccal cavity, especially since the distal parts of these filtering plates make up a key component of the EBOs. EBOs, food aggregating structures found in many teleosts, are thought to have independently evolved at least six times. Ranging in complexity from small slits on the dorsal wall of the pharyngeal cavity to exceedingly intricate spiraling structures, EBOs are morphologically diverse among filter-feeding fishes. Despite this morphological diversity and broad taxonomic distribution, little is known regarding the functional anatomy of the EBO. Moreover, the EBO in silver carp is distinct from the organs previously described in other species, being created by four independent pharyngeal involutions (instead of the more typical one or two) that form spiral-shaped pharyngeal tubes surrounded by circumferential muscle. On each side of the head greatly hypertrophied hyomandibulae and opercles are connected to the anterior cartilaginous caps of the bilateral EBOs via enlarged muscles. Given that these fish are pump filter feeders we hypothesize that the opercula may compress and expand the EBOs during pumping causing food to be moved posteriorly toward the pharyngeal jaws.",yes
"Cohen, K. E., and L. P. Hernandez",2018,Making a master filterer: Ontogeny of specialized filtering plates in silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix),Journal of Morphology,279,7,925-935,"Filter feeding fishes possess several morphological adaptations necessary to capture and concentrate small particulate matter from the water column. Filter feeding teleosts typically employ elongated and tightly packed gill rakers with secondary bony or epithelial modifications that increase filtering efficiency. The gill rakers of Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, silver carp, are anatomically distinct from and more complex than the filtering apparatus of other teleostean fishes. The silver carp filtering apparatus is composed of biserial, fused filtering plates used to capture particles ranging in size from 4 to 80 m. Early in ontogeny, at 15-25 mm standard length (SL), silver carp gill rakers are reminiscent of other more stereotypical teleostean rakers, characterized by individual lanceolate rakers that are tightly packed along the entirety of the branchial arches. At 30 mm SL, secondary epithelial projections and concomitant dermal ossification begin to stitch together individual gill rakers. During later juvenile stages, dermal bone further modifies the individual gill rakers and creates a bony scaffold that supports the now fully fused and porous epithelium. By adulthood, the stitching of bone and complete fusion of the overlying epithelium creates rigid filtering plates with morphologically distinct faces. The inner face of the plates is organized into a net-like matrix while the outer face has a sponge-like appearance comprised of differently sized pores. Here, we present morphological data from an ontogenetic series of the filtering apparatus within silver carp. These data inform hypotheses regarding both how these gill raker plates may have evolved from a more basal condition, as well as how this novel architecture allows this species to feed on exceedingly small phytoplankton, particles that represent a greater filtering challenge to the typical anatomy of the gill rakers of fishes.",yes

Silver carp utilize modified gill rakers to capture a specific range of food; however, their greatly modified filtering morphology allows them to feed on phytoplankton and zooplankton ranging in size from 4 to 85 µm. The filtering apparatus of silver carp comprises rigid filtering plates where the outer anatomy of these plates is characterized by long parallel channels that change in orientation along the length of the plate. Here, we investigate the underlying morphology and concomitant hydrodynamics that support the filtration mechanisms of silver and bighead carp. Bighead carp are also invasive filter feeders, but their filtering apparatus is morphologically distinct from that of silver carp. Using 3D particle image velocimetry, we determined how particles and fluid interact with the surface of the gill rakers/plates. Filtering plates in silver carp induce strong directed vortical flow, whereas the filtering apparatus of bighead carp resulted in a type of haphazard cross-flow filtration. The organized vortical flow established by silver carp likely increased the number of interactions that the particle-filled water had with the filtering membrane. This strong vortical organization is maintained only at 0.75 body lengths s<sup>-1</sup>, and vortical flow is poorly developed and maintained at slower and faster speeds. Moreover, we found that absolute vorticity magnitude in silver carp is an order of magnitude greater than in bighead carp.",yes

Goforth",2022,"Consistency of mobile and sedentary movement extremes exhibited by an invasive fish, silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix",Biological Invasions,,,,"Within many populations, some individuals may be more apt to move, and these individuals can substantially impact population dynamics. Invasive Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) have spread throughout much of the Mississippi River Basin, and their presence has resulted in multiple negative ecosystem effects. Silver Carp are known to move hundreds of km, which has likely contributed to their rapid spread. Our study examined movement patterns and environmental cues for movement in Silver Carp based on acoustic telemetry of tagged fish that ranged widely (i.e., mobile) and those that did not range far from the site of their original capture and tagging (i.e., sedentary) in the Wabash River, USA. Sedentary and mobile designations were made based on observed extremes of mean annual ranges, and these designations were consistent within seasons and among years. Both movement groups displayed seasonal variation in movements, with mobile Silver Carp consistently moving greater distances within each season and sedentary Silver Carp exhibiting lower variability in distances moved than mobile individuals. Discharge (change in discharge) and temperature were significant predictors of mobile and sedentary individuals' movements. Additional environmental variables (i.e., cumulative growing degree day, day of year, and change in temperature) also related to movement likelihood of sedentary individuals, whereas total length was the only additional variable that influenced movement likelihood of mobile individuals. Total length was significantly related to movement distance for both groups of Silver Carp, but the relationship was negative for sedentary fish and positive for mobile fish. Results point to differences in behavior that may require targeted management strategies to achieve agency goals to interrupt mobile individual movements that can result in range expansion. Such strategies may also limit introductions and invasions by other aquatic invasive species that exhibit similar behaviors.",yes
"Coulter, A. A., H. K. Swanson, and R. R.

Diet overlap between invasive Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and native planktivores has been linked to declines in condition and abundance of native planktivores. However, there is little information on how such diet overlap varies temporally. We used stable-isotope ratios to examine seasonal resource overlap among Silver Carp and two native planktivores, Gizzard Shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) and Bigmouth Buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus). Resource overlap between Bigmouth Buffalo and Silver Carp was minimal (<1%) in all seasons, whereas overlap between Gizzard Shad and Silver Carp (7-36%) was larger and varied seasonally. The greatest resource overlap among species occurred in summer, while the smallest overlap occurred in spring. Resource use by Silver Carp appears to be highly specialized in the fall, as indicated by a narrow isotopic niche.Variation in niche size among seasons suggests that Silver Carp may be plastic in their resource use. Overall, the limited resource overlap among invasive and native species revealed in this study suggests potentially low invasive-native competition, although competition may have acted prior to our study to produce shifts in resource use by native fishes.",yes

We quantified fish density throughout the 460 km long Illinois River using hydroacoustic surveys at 23 sites while concurrently collecting 192 surface water samples for eDNA analysis. We found that Silver Carp numerical density and biomass density were positively and non-linearly related to eDNA concentration and detection rate. Both eDNA concentration (copy number) and detection rate increased rapidly as Silver Carp density increased but plateaued at moderate densities. These relationships could prove useful for estimating Silver Carp relative abundance in newly invaded locations where population numbers are low to moderate.

Invasive species pose a dominant threat to biodiversity and biosecurity, particularly in biodiversity hotspots like Kruger National Park, South Africa. The invasive silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, was introduced into the Olifants River and may experience range spread owing to favorable environmental conditions. Intensive monitoring protocols are necessary to effectively manage invasions of species like silver carp. Unfortunately, tropical and sub-tropical aquatic systems are difficult to monitor using conventional methods (e.g., netting, electrofishing and snorkeling) owing to a range of factors including the presence of dangerous megafauna. Conservation of such systems may be advanced by the adoption of novel methods, including environmental DNA (eDNA) detection. Here, we explore the utility of environmental DNA (eDNA) to conduct safe, reliable and repeatable surveys in dangerous watersheds using silver carp as a case study. We conducted eDNA surveys at 12 sites in two neighbouring watersheds, and determined that the species has expanded its range within the Olifants River and to the south in the Sabie River. Expansion in the former is consistent with the presence of suitable spawning conditions. We discuss the implications of this survey for biodiversity monitoring in similar aquatic systems in the tropics and advocate an integrative approach to biomonitoring in these ecosystems.",yes

Invasive silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) exert substantial pressure on the link between primary production and intermediate trophic levels in large rivers of the Midwestern USA. The goal of our manuscript was to describe the silver carp population invasion in the Illinois River (Illinois, USA) and explore the potential effects of silver carp on the native biota.We obtained 22 years of data from three long‐term monitoring programmes for phytoplankton, zooplankton, and age‐0 and adult native fishes. To determine when silver carp started affecting native biota, we used nonlinear regression to estimate the change point in silver carp biomass. We then used piecewise linear regression to separately model the response of phytoplankton and age‐0 and adult native fishes, using the model‐estimated change point in silver carp biomass. We tested for differences in taxon‐specific zooplankton density and biomass between pre‐ and post‐establishment periods using generalised linear models. To explore associations between native biota, silver carp and other potential drivers, we used single‐factor linear‐regression models in an information theoretic‐based approach.Our analysis showed individual silver carp condition decreased while their population numbers and biomass increased during their establishment in the Illinois River. Concurrently, analysis of 22 years of producer and consumer abundance and biomass data shows phytoplankton density and macrozooplankton density and biomass decreased—zooplankton by over 90%—during the same period, though the responses of age‐0 native fish biomass and adult native fish biomass were more nuanced.Our study provides compelling evidence of multiple trophic‐level effects from the silver carp invasion in North America and highlights the importance of long‐term data collection and monitoring. Our research shows managers that zooplankton and perhaps phytoplankton are quickly and negatively affected by silver carp, which may eventually cascade into higher trophic levels over longer timescales.",yes

Few studies have attempted to investigate the survival of pelagic fish influenced by TDG supersaturated water and compare the tolerance characteristics to TDG supersaturation between benthic and pelagic fish. To identify the survival of fish species that inhabit the various water layers affected by TDG supersaturation, silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) (pelagic fish) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) (benthic fish) were chosen to conduct an acute exposure experiment of four different TDG supersaturation levels (125%, 130%, 135% and 140%). The findings illustrated that the two fish species both exhibited evident aberrant behaviours of maladjustment in TDG supersaturated water. Obvious GBD symptoms were also found in the test fish. The survival probability of silver carp and common carp decreased with increasing levels of TDG supersaturation. The median survival time (ST50) values of the silver carp exposed to four levels of TDG supersaturated water (125%, 130%, 135% and 140%) were 26.84, 7.96, 5.56 and 3.62 h, respectively, whereas the ST50 values of common carp were 53.50, 26.00, 16.50 and 11.70 h, respectively. When compared with common carp, silver carp had a weaker tolerance to TDG-supersaturated water and were vulnerable to GBD. It shows that levels above 125% are not safe for common carp survival. In terms of the tolerance threshold value, silver carp merits further investigation because it showed lower tolerance to TDG than did common carp.",yes

The number of alleles (Na), the observed and expected heterozygosity (Ho and He), and the polymorphic information content (PIC) of twelve loci were ranged from 5 to 20, 0.189 to 0.956, 0.177 to 901, and 0.169 to 0.887, respectively. Overall, almost all the microsatellite loci were detected as highly polymorphic across the two species. The populations of same species showed close genetic distances and similar genetic structures. Significant genetic differentiations were only detected between populations from different species, with a higher variation between species (21.17%) compared with that between populations within species (0.18%). In the species and simulated hybrid discrimination analyses, the individuals from different species were separated distinctly, and the simulated hybrids could almost be separated with the true individuals.

There is no available ecological information about this parasitic infection in wild host fish. The present work aimed to investigate the infection rate and distribution of C. schistorchis in wild silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrbc, and to assess the influence of environmental factors on infection by the parasite. From October 2016 to May 2019, a total of 554 wild silver carp were collected from two reservoirs. These collected fish were weighed, measured, and dissected to observe the presence of C. schistorchis following standard methodology. Ecological analysis results showed that the frequency distribution of C. schistorchis in the host population was aggregated distribution. The abundance of C. schistorchis exhibited a positive correlation with the host age and condition factor of silver carp, but it showed no relationship with water temperature, pH or DO. The condition factor value of infected fish was significantly higher than that of uninfected fish. These results indicated that food intake, not environmental factors, directly determined infection by the parasite in the host, indicating that an increased food intake would increase the risk of infection. Thus, the number of parasites could be used as an indirect biological marker for assessing the effectiveness of silver carp in filter-feeding on plankton. The following analysis indicated that silver carp with a body length of 50-55 cm showed the highest efficiency in controlling phytoplankton biomass.

However, the use of filter-feeding aquatic animals to control eutrophic water bodies remains debatable. As such, more work is needed to understand the combined effects of submerged macrophytes and aquatic animals on the restoration of eutrophic water bodies. In this study, we first conducted a mesocosm experiment to evaluate the combined effects of submerged macrophytes and aquatic animals on water body restoration, and then applied these results in the field. We found that silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) deteriorated water quality by increasing nutrient and total suspended solid concentrations, and decreased the biomass of submerged macrophytes. However, triangle sail mussels (Hyriopsis cumingii) promoted the establishment of a clear-water state by grazing on phytoplankton and detritus, and stimulating submerged macrophyte growth. In practical ecological engineering, we suggest that silver carp can be used at low density (20 g/m(3)) as a biomanipulation tool, despite their potential to deteriorate water quality. Furthermore, stocking mussels in nets at a biomass of 150 g/m3 can be effectively used to restore eutrophicated water bodies. Finally, Hydrilla verticillata and Potamogeton malaianus, in combination with filter-feeding aquatic animals, are suitable submerged macrophyte species for the restoration of eutrophicated lakes.

The addition of spirulina increased detections of silver carp by 2–3 fold, while eDNA concentrations increased by 4-fold on the test side when compared to the side without the stimulus. The addition of the sex pheromone increased detections of common carp by ~25-fold, where a 6-fold increase in eDNA concentrations was measured (p < 0.05).

The model assumes a conservative breeding population estimate ranging between 6000 and 8000 cormorants distributed among three large colonies in the Chicago metropolitan area. The model also assumes that cormorants are distributing feces randomly throughout the CAWS in proportion to the amount of time spent at each location. Results show that cormorants may be contributing 2.6 to 113 target marker copies/m(2)/day if birds are spending 22% of their time on open water and 6.4 to 291 target marker copies/m2/day if birds are spending 56% of their time on open water.

A transcriptomic approach using RNA sequencing and analysis of plasma variables were used to quantify differences among fish at the leading edge and two downstream core population sites. Leading-edge fish exhibited upregulation of genes associated with xenobiotic defense (e.g., ATP-binding cassette C1 [abcc1], abcc2, abcc6), decreased cell integrity (i.e., macroautophagy and apoptosis; autophagy-related protein 9A [atg9a], caspase 3b [casp3b]), and cholesterol metabolism (e.g., abca1, apolipoprotein A1 [apoa1], sterol O-acyltransferase [soat1]) and downregulation of genes associated with DNA repair (e.g., tumor suppressor p53-binding protein 1 [tp53bp1]) compared to core population sites.

Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) is sometimes challenged by hypoxia during intensive aquaculture or because of environmental changes. However, the response to hypoxic stress in the heart of silver carp remains relatively unknown. In the present study, we reported the effects of hypoxia on histological structures, enzyme activities, and gene expression in the heart of silver carp. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of heart sections showed that the myocardial fibers gradually became disordered, swollen, and even ruptured during hypoxic treatment. These phenotypes were also supported by increased activities of injury-related enzymes. Moreover, the tran-scriptome was analyzed to determine the molecular strategies of hypoxia adaptation in the heart. PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, and JAK-STAT signaling pathway were the most prominent path-ways activated by hypoxia. Twenty significantly differentially expressed genes were selected to create a network diagram related to cell proliferation, carbohydrate metabolism, oxidative stress, and angiogenesis. Additionally, reoxygenation could ameliorate cardiac injury and eliminate the effects of hypoxia on gene expression. This was the first comparative transcriptomic study to explore the molecular mechanism of the response to hypoxia and reoxygenation in the heart of silver carp.

The gill is the first tissue attacked by hypoxia; however, the response of the gills of H. molitrix to hypoxia stress at the tissue, cellular, and molecular levels has not been clearly established. The influence of hypoxia on histological features along with gene expression in silver carp gills were explored in this research. The hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections and electron microscopy examinations of gills indicated that the gill lamellae were seriously twisted, gill filaments were dehisced, and the swelling and shedding of epithelial cell layer in the gill tissue were intensified along with the degree of hypoxia. In the hypoxia, semi-asphyxia, and asphyxia groups, the gill transcriptomic assessment of shifts in key genes, as well as modulatory networks in response to hypoxic conditions revealed 587, 725, and 748 differentially expressed genes, respectively. These genes are abundant in immune response signaling cascades (e.g., complement and coagulation cascades, Nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor signaling cascade, and differentiation of Th1 along with Th2 cells) and oxygen transport [e.g., MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling cascades]. Genes linked to immune response (e.g., c2, c3, c6, klf4, cxcr4, cd45, and cd40) and oxygen transport (e.g., egln1, egln3, epo, ldh, and vegfa) were additionally identified. According to our findings, the silver carp may be using HIF-1"" to obtain additional oxygen during hypoxia. These findings illustrate that hypoxia stress might damage gill tissue, trigger an immunological response, and activate HIF-1 signaling to increase oxygen availability under hypoxic situations.

Analysis of more than 590,000 quality-filtered sequences obtained from the foregut, midgut and hindgut of these four carp species revealed high microbial diversity among the samples. The foregut samples of grass carp exhibited more than 1,600 operational taxonomy units (OTUs) and the highest alpha-diversity index, followed by the silver carp foregut and midgut. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria were the predominant phyla regardless of fish species or gut type. Pairwise (weighted) UniFrac distance-based permutational multivariate analysis of variance with fish species as a factor produced significant association (P < 0.01). The gut microbiotas of all four carp species harbored saccharolytic or proteolytic microbes, likely in response to the differences in their feeding habits. In addition, extensive variations were also observed even within the same fish species.

In this study, the full-length cDNAs of three PHD genes were obtained from Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, which is an important freshwater fish and sensitive to low oxygen tension. The amino acid sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis of PHDs were performed among various species. Furthermore, the expression patterns and the transcriptional responses of H. molitrix PHD genes to acute hypoxia, continued hypoxia, and reoxygenation were explored in different tissues. Our study preliminarily explored the physiological regulation functions of PHD genes at the transcriptional level when addressing the hypoxic challenge and provided a foundation for future systematic explorations of the molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxia adaptation in silver carp. As an economically and ecologically important freshwater fish, silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) is sensitive to low oxygen tension. Prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) proteins are critical regulators of adaptive responses to hypoxia for their function of regulating the hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha subunit (HIF-1 alpha) stability via hydroxylation reaction. In the present study, three PHD genes were cloned from H. molitrix by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The total length of HmPHD1, HmPHD2, and HmPHD3 were 2981, 1954, and 1847 base pair (bp), and contained 1449, 1080, and 738 bp open reading frames (ORFs) that encoded 482, 359, and 245 amino acids (aa), respectively. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that HmPHD1, HmPHD2, and HmPHD3 had the conserved prolyl 4-hydroxylase alpha subunit homolog domains at their C-termini. Meanwhile, the evaluation of phylogeny revealed PHD2 and PHD3 of H. molitrix were more closely related as they belonged to sister clades, whereas the clade of PHD1 was relatively distant from these two. The transcripts of PHD genes are ubiquitously distributed in H. molitrix tissues, with the highest expressional level of HmPHD1 and HmPHD3 in liver, and HmPHD2 in muscle. After acute hypoxic treatment for 0.5 h, PHD genes of H. molitrix were induced mainly in liver and brain, and different from HmPHD1 and HmPHD2, the expression of HmPHD3 showed no overt tissue specificity. Furthermore, under continued hypoxic condition, PHD genes exhibited an obviously rapid but gradually attenuated response from 3 h to 24 h, and upon reoxygenation, the transcriptional expression of PHD genes showed a decreasing trend in most of the tissues. These results indicate that the PHD genes of H. molitrix are involved in the early response to hypoxic stress, and they show tissue-specific transcript expression when performing physiological regulation functions. This study is of great relevance for advancing our understanding of how PHD genes are regulated when addressing the hypoxic challenge and provides a reference for the subsequent research of the molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxia adaptation in silver carp.",yes

Most relevant models are nonlinear, however, and data available from real world ecosystems are too noisy and sparsely sampled for common inference approaches. Here we improved the inference of generalized Lotka–Volterra (gLV) ecological networks by using a new optimization algorithm to constrain parameter signs with prior knowledge and a perturbation-based ensemble method. Results We applied the new inference to long-term species abundance data from the freshwater fish community in the Illinois River, United States. We constructed an ensemble of 668 gLV models that explained 79% of the data on average. The models indicated (at a 70% level of confidence) a strong positive interaction from emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides) to channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), which we could validate using data from a nearby observation site, and predicted that the relative abundances of most fish species will continue to fluctuate temporally and concordantly in the near future. The network shows that the invasive silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) has much stronger impacts on native predators than on prey, supporting the notion that the invader perturbs the native food chain by replacing the diets of predators. Conclusions Ensemble approaches constrained by prior knowledge can improve inference and produce networks from noisy and sparsely sampled time series data to fill knowledge gaps on real world ecosystems. Such network models could aid efforts to conserve ecosystems such as the Illinois River, which is threatened by the invasion of the silver carp.",yes

However, field investigations have showed that such stocking would enhance instead of controlling phyto-plankton in these reservoirs. Reservoirs generally receive a considerable amount of detritus from their catch-ments which may constitute an important carbon source to filter-feeding fish. Whether direct consumption of detritus increases the availability of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (P) to phytoplankton and thereby provides resilience against the control of phytoplankton biomass is debated. We conducted an enclosure experiment in a (sub)tropical Chinese reservoir (Liuxihe Reservoir) to assess how a gradient of filter-feeding fish (Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) biomass affected P dynamics and fish grazing and predation when subsidized by allochthonous detritus. Fish had strong effects on the dynamics and fluxes of P. TP concentration in the water column increased over time in all enclosures, but the presence of fish slowed its increase. Thus, TP decreased with increasing fish biomass. Fish were a net sink of P to the water column, because they gained mass during the experiment. Moreover, P sequestered by fish could largely account for the lower TP concentrations observed in enclosures with fish compared to fishless enclosures. Fish presence at high biomass strongly reduced the abundance of large zooplankton species and P excretion by zooplankton. However, the negative effect of fish predation on zooplankton was negligible when fish was present at low biomass. Increasing fish biomass increased the relative role of fish in P cycling but decreased the overall P excretion by fish and zooplankton. Compared to enclosures with high fish biomass, both zooplankton grazing effect on phytoplankton (zooplankton: phyto-plankton biomass ratio as a proxy) and the overall P excretion were much higher, whereas fish grazing effect on phytoplankton (fish: phytoplankton biomass ratio as a proxy), chlorophyll a and the yield of chlorophyll a per TP were much lower in enclosures with low fish biomass. This suggested that phytoplankton limitation might shift from one of zooplankton control to one of limitation by P availability with increasing fish biomass. Relative to fish mediated P recycling and fish grazing, zooplankton grazing appeared to be more important as a driver of trophic cascades in systems subsidized by allochthonous detritus. Silver Carp stocked at high biomass would strongly reduce zooplankton grazing pressure and increase the yield of phytoplankton per TP.",yes

In our study, the dominant bacterial and cellulolytic bacterial (Clostridium I, Clostridium III, Clostridium XIVab, and Fibrobacter) communities in the contents and mucus of the silver carp gut (foregut, midgut, and hindgut) were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses. The results revealed that the dominant and cellulolytic bacterial communities were significantly different among gut regions as well as in contents and mucus. Bacterial diversity and richness in contents and mucus increased along the gut and were higher in contents than those in local mucus. A sequence analysis of gut samples exhibited the conservative phylotypes of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes. The gut of silver carp harbored an abundance of cellulolytic bacteria, particularly Clostridium XIV ab. The foregut segment had the highest proportions of the four cellulolytic bacteria, followed by the midgut and hindgut. However, the proportions of cellulolytic species in the silver carp gut was much lower than those in the terrestrial vertebrate gastrointestinal tract.

Samples were taken seven times over a 49-d period, and BCC was analyzed by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Results revealed that introduction of C. carpio and H. molitrix had a remarkable impact on the composition of bacterioplankton communities, and the BCC was significantly different between each treatment. Sequencing of DGGE bands revealed that the bacterioplankton community in the different treatment groups was consistent at a taxonomic level, but differed in its abundance. H. molitrix promoted the richness of Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria, while more bands affiliated to Cyanobacteria were detected in C. carpio mesocosms. The redundancy analysis (RDA) result demonstrated that the BCC was closely related to the bottom-up (total phosphorus, chlorophyll a, phytoplankton biomass) and top-down forces (biomass of copepods and cladocera) in C. carpio and control mesocosms, respectively. We found no evidence for top-down regulation of BCC by zooplankton in H. molitrix mesocosms, while grazing by protozoa (heterotrophic nanoflagellates, ciliates) became the major way to regulate BCC. Total bacterioplankton abundances were significantly higher in C. carpio mesocosms because of high nutrient concentration and suspended solids.

The number of oriental river prawns killed was significantly less than that of fish species, comparing the 1st hour with the 24th hour (p < 0.01). The feeding rhythm of LB varied significantly from crayfish to fish. Numerically, Jacobs' selection index reinforced LB's special preference for predating G. affinis. Although there were obvious variations in predation capacity and feed selection, no statistically significant growth differences were detected among LB groups feeding on live M. nipponense, G. affinis, H. molitrix, and C. molitorella (p < 0.05).

We made measurements on 4 dates over a 2-y period, which spanned a range of hydrologic connectivity between the lake and the river and a variety of fish sizes. We quantified selection by comparing phytoplankton community composition in the lake to prey in foreguts of captured Silver Carp using Vanderploeg and Scavia's (1979) relativized selection index. With a possible exception of diatoms on 1 date, there was no relationship of sample date or fish size on prey selection. However, there was a consistent pattern in prey selection: euglenoid algae were positively selected, selection of colonial algae and diatoms was variable, and flagellates and filamentous cyanobacteria were negatively selected. Results are discussed in the context of a conceptual model for Silver Carp phytoplanktivory that incorporates the roles of habitat selection, prey availability, prey capture and processing, and digestive physiology.",yes

We used Mississippi River Basin fish community data collected by the Long Term Resource Monitoring program and the Missouri Department of Conservation to evaluate possible interaction between Asian Carp and native fishes. Results from two decades of long-term monitoring throughout much of the Mississippi River suggest that Silver Carp relative abundance has increased while relative abundance (Bigmouth Buffalo [F (3, 8240) = 6.44, P<0.01] and Gizzard Shad [F (3, 8240) = 31.04, P<0.01]) and condition (Bigmouth Buffalo [slope = -0.11; t = -1.71; P = 0.1014] and Gizzard Shad [slope = -0.39; t = -3.02; P = 0.0073]) of native planktivores have declined. Floodplain lake qualitative evaluations yielded similar results; floodplain lake fish communities were likely altered (i.e., reductions in native species) by Silver Carp. Furthermore, laboratory experiments corroborated field evidence; Silver Carp negatively influence native planktivores through competition for prey (all comparisons, P > 0.05). To this end, this study provides evidence that Silver Carp are likely adversely influencing native fishes; however, mere presence of Silver Carp in the system does not induce deleterious effects on native fishes. To the best of our knowledge, this evaluation is the first to describe the effects of Asian Carp throughout the Mississippi River Basin and could be used to reduce the effects of Asian Carp on native biota through an integrated pest management program as suggested by congressional policy. Despite the simplicity of the data analyzed and approach used, this study provides a framework for beginning to identify the interactions of invasive fish pests on native fishes (i.e., necessary first step of integrated pest management). However, knowledge gaps remain. We suggest future efforts should conduct more in depth analyses (i.e., multivariate statistical approaches) that investigate the influence on all native species.",yes

In view of the above, the susceptibility of three carp species, namely catla (Catla catla), mrigal (Cirrhinus mrigala) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) was evaluated vis-a-vis tilapia, following experimental infection with TiLV. No clinical signs and histopathological alterations could be observed in carps. RT-qPCR revealed that TiLV copy numbers in liver and brain of all the three carps were almost negligible and did not show any increase with time, suggesting that the virus did not replicate in liver and brain, the target organs of TiLV. Further, TiLV could not be isolated from pooled liver and brain tissues of carps using permissive CFF cell line. On the contrary, in tilapia, typical clinical signs and histopathological lesions were observed and there was significant increase in TiLV copy number up to 6 days post-injection. Furthermore, the virus was successfully isolated from pooled liver and brain tissue of infected tilapia.

We sought to evaluate range size and habitat use of an invasive species (Silver Carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) in an unimpounded river reach (Wabash River, IN), to provide insights into the dispersal of invasive species and their potential overlap with native species. We hypothesized that range size would increase with fish length, be similar among sexes, and vary annually while habitats used would be deeper, warmer, lower velocity, and of finer substrate. Silver Carp habitat use supported our hypotheses but range size did not vary with sex or length. 75% home range varied annually, suggesting that core areas occupied by individuals may change relative to climate-based factors (e.g., water levels), whereas broader estimates of range size remained constant across years. Ranges were often centered on landscape features such as tributaries and backwaters. Results of this study indicate habitat and landscape features as potential areas where Silver Carp impacts on native ecosystems may be the greatest. Observed distribution of range sizes indicates the presence of sedentary and mobile individuals within the population. Mobile individuals may be of particular importance as they drive the spread of the invasive species into new habitats.",yes

There are numerous fish species and due to their close resemblance with each other, it is difficult to classify them by external characters.

The proposed CNN architecture contains 32 deep layers that are considerably deep to derive valuable and discriminating features from the image. The deep supervision is inflicted on the VGGNet architecture to increase the classification performance by instantly adding four convolutional layers to the training of each level in the network.

The results indicated that MC-LR content in water ranged from 0.18 to 3.02 mu g/L in dissolved fraction and undetectable level to 1.13 mu g/L in cellular fraction, in all three seasons. The results of PCA revealed that the environmental parameters including EC, Chl-a, PO43-, pH and temperature were the most effective factors influencing the MC-LR production. Results further showed the mean concentration of MC-LR in muscle and liver of silver carp ranged from 10.12 to 40.98 and from undetectable to 44.34 mu g/kg w.w, respectively. The mean concentration of MC-LR in northern pike was 15.18 to 35.1 mu g/kg w.w in muscle and undetectable to 51.91 mu g/kg w.w in liver samples.

Riverine fish are subjected to heterogeneous flow velocities and turbulence, which may affect their movements and ability to pass the fishways. However, studies focusing on fish response to turbulent flows are lacking for many species. Here we investigate the effects of the turbulence created by a vertical half‐cylinder of various diameters (1.9, 2.5, 3.2 and 5.0 cm) on the swimming ability and behaviour of silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix. The large D‐cylinders (3.0 and 5.0 cm) create specific vorticity and reduced velocities areas in their vicinity, which favours flow refuging behaviours (FRBs) and thus increased relative critical swimming speeds (Urcrit, BL/s) of silver carp, by comparison to free‐flow conditions and cylinders of smaller diameter (1.9 and 2.5 cm). The flow speed at which silver carp maximized FRBs such as Karman gaiting downstream of the cylinder, holding position in the bow wake or entraining on the side ranged from 40 to 70 cm s−1, depending on fish body size. When holding station near a cylinder under optimal flow speeds, the distance between the fish and the cylinder is related to the size of the fish, but also to the size of the cylinder and the produced vortices. The optimal holding region in the drag wake of the cylinder ranged from 28 to 40 cm downstream of the centre of the cylinder, depending on the size of the fish. Smaller fish, however, tend to use the reduced velocities areas located in the bow wake of the large cylinders. We hypothesize that fish will display FRBs, including maintaining a Karman gait in turbulent flow, when the ratio of the cylinder diameter to their body length is between 1:3 and 1:4. They also match their tail beat frequency to the vortex shedding frequency of the cylinder.

In this study, we found that obstacle shape can affect swimming ability of fish: our results suggested that a half cylinder improved critical swimming speed of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) compared with swimming downstream of a full cylinder, square tube or for free‐flow conditions. We also discovered how silver carp alter their locomotory behavior in response to turbulent flow caused by varying flow velocities around obstacles. At a flow velocity of 1 BL/s (body length per second), the fish spent similar percentages of time between holding station and moving forward behind the half cylinder: their motions resembled freestream swimming behavior. The greatest percentage of time spent downstream of the half cylinder occurred at a flow velocity of 5 BL/s. Fish were unstable and displayed irregular body motions with large lateral displacement at 5 BL/s. However, the fish held station for a long time and moved forward steadily behind the half cylinder at 3 BL/s. In holding station behind the half cylinder, fish maintained constant tail‐beat frequency and tail‐ beat amplitude when flow velocity was increased from 1 to 3 BL/s. In moving forward behind the half cylinder, fish increased tail‐beat frequency and tail‐beat amplitude while maintaining constant ground swimming speed, swimming acceleration and ground stride when flow velocity was increased from 3 to 5 BL/s. Moreover, fish positioned their snouts in a small area approximately 1–3 BL downstream from the half cylinder at 3 BL/s. These behaviors support the hypothesis that turbulence behind a half cylinder was a suitable location for fish to conserve energy at 3 BL/s.

However, the benefit of stocking silver carp to restore eutrophic lakes remains controversial and the reasons for the different responses observed are unclear. In this study, we conducted an outdoor experiment to assess the impact of the biomass level of four silver carp (c. 0, 25, 50, and 100 g/m(3)) on phytoplankton through direct grazing and fish-mediated nutrient recycling, respectively. We used a nested design with nutrient-permeable chambers with or without fish placed inside ponds. In this way, the phytoplankton incubated outside the chambers was affected by both consumer grazing and nutrient recycling, whereas the phytoplankton inside the fish-free chambers was only affected by consumer-mediated nutrient recycling. Outside the chambers, the concentrations of total nitrogen, dissolved total nitrogen, and total phosphorus did not differ significantly among the treatments, whereas the dissolved total phosphorus level was significantly higher in the fishless treatment. The concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl a), phytoplankton biomass and the ratio of nanophytoplankton Chl a to total phytoplankton Chl a in the fish-present treatments were significantly higher than in the fishless treatment and the phytoplankton was dominated by small-sized species. While the zooplankton biomass and zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratio were significantly lower in the fish-present treatments, indicating a strong fish predation on zooplankton. As for the water inside the chambers, there was no significant difference among the four treatments for any of the measured variables except total phosphorus. Our results suggest that silver carp indirectly stimulated phytoplankton growth by reducing the zooplankton grazing rather than through nutrient recycling, and that fish grazing on phytoplankton could not compensate for the loss of grazing by zooplankton, leading to higher phytoplankton biomass when silver carp was present. The benefit of using filter-feeding fish as a biomanipulation tool to create clear water is therefore questionable unless control of nanophytoplankton can be achieved.",yes

Traditional analyses often assume uncorrelated or weakly correlated temporal structure in fisheries data time series. We propose that frequency and scale domain methods, in the form of wavelet transforms, can serve as useful probes in early investigations of fisheries data, finding out the mechanisms underlying the changes in the diversity and abundance of fishes. We used cross-wavelet analysis with phase angle and coherency parameters to study the effect of discharge on the occurrence of silver carp larvae in a large subtropical river. Simulation studies show that the spectral signature given by the cross-wavelet method provided a useful approach for statistically detecting and characterizing temporal dependency in the occurrence of fish larvae. In addition, our simulations provide an objective, quantitative basis for understanding how river flow rate acts as a trigger for the occurrence of larvae. And our results can be used to ecological operation silver carp larvae were found when discharge was greater than 10(4) m(3) s(-1). The flood peak persists for some days (at least 2 days) and can induce a peak in larval abundance. Our analyses also show that flood duration and the flood total volume decreased from 2006 to 2013. Moreover the flood occurred earlier each year. This may be why the period of most intense spawning (the day of maximum larvae collected) was earlier each year. We conclude with a discussion about the role wavelet analysis may have in appropriately guiding flexible probabilistic models connecting fisheries with environmental covariates. The wavelet approach is an especially promising tool for analyzing ecological data, such as the relationship between hydrological conditions and fish larva occurrence.",yes

Stepien",2020,Increasing confidence for discerning species and population compositions from metabarcoding assays of environmental samples: Case studies of fishes in the laurentian Great Lakes and wabash river,Metabarcoding and Metagenomics,4,,,"Community composition data are essential for conservation management, facilitating identification of rare native and invasive species, along with abundant ones. However, traditional capture-based morphological surveys require considerable taxonomic expertise, are time consuming and expensive, can kill rare taxa and damage habitats, and often are prone to false negatives. Alternatively, metabarcoding assays can be used to assess the genetic identity and compositions of entire communities from environmental samples, comprising a more sensitive, less damaging, and relatively time- and cost-efficient approach. However, there is a trade-off between the stringency of bioinformatic filtering needed to remove false positives and the potential for false negatives. The present investigation thus evaluated use of four mitochondrial (mt) DNA metabarcoding assays and a customized bioinformatic Bioinformatic pipeline to increase confidence in species identifications by removing false positives, while achieving high detection probability. Positive controls were used to calculate sequencing error, and results that fell below those cutoff values were removed, unless found with multiple assays. The performance of this approach was tested to discern and identify North American freshwater fishes using lab experiments (mock communities and aquarium experiments) and processing of a bulk ichthyoplankton sample. The method then was applied to field environmental (e) DNA water samples taken concomitant with electrofishing surveys and morphological identifications. This protocol detected 100% of species present in concomitant electrofishing surveys in the Wabash River and an additional 21 that were absent from traditional sampling. Using single 1 L water samples collected from just four locations, the metabarcoding assays discerned 73% of the total fish species that were discerned during four months of an extensive electrofishing river survey in the Maumee River, along with an additional nine species. In both rivers, total fish species diversity was best resolved when all four metabarcoding assays were used together, which identified 35 additional species missed by electrofishing. Ecological distinction and diversity levels among the fish communities also were better resolved with the metabarcoding assays than with morphological sampling and identifications, especially using all four assays together. At the population-level, metabarcoding analyses targeting the invasive round goby Neogobius melanostomus and the silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix identified all population haplotype variants found using Sanger sequencing of morphologically sampled fish, along with additional intra-specific diversity, meriting further investigation. Overall findings demonstrated that the use of multiple metabarcoding assays and custom bioinformatics that filter potential error from true positive detections improves confidence in evaluating biodiversity.",yes

Optimizing eDNA sampling protocols can be challenging because there is imperfect understanding of how each step of the protocol influences its sensitivity. This paper develops a probabilistic model that characterizes each step of an eDNA sampling protocol to evaluate the protocol's overall detection sensitivity for one sample. The model is then applied to analyse how changes over time made to the eDNA sampling protocol to detect bighead (BH) and silver carp (SC) eDNA have influenced its sensitivity, and hence interpretation of the results. The model shows that changes to the protocol have caused the sensitivity of the protocol to fluctuate. A more efficient extraction method in 2013, new species-specific markers with a qPCR assay in 2014, and a more efficient capture method in 2015 have improved the sensitivity, while switching to a larger elution volume in 2013 and a smaller sample volume in 2015 have reduced the sensitivity. Overall, the sensitivity of the current protocol is higher for BH eDNA detection and SC eDNA detection compared to the original protocol used from 2009 to 2012. The paper shows how this model of eDNA sampling can be used to evaluate the effect of proposed changes in an eDNA sampling and analysis protocol on the sensitivity of that protocol to help researchers optimize their design.",yes

One confounding factor when interpreting eDNA sampling evidence is that eDNA can be present in the water in the absence of living target organisms, originating from excreta, dead tissue, boats, or sewage effluent, etc. In the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS), electric fish dispersal barriers were built to prevent non-native Asian carp species from invading Lake Michigan, and yet Asian carp eDNA has been detected above the barriers sporadically since 2009. In this paper the influence of stream flow characteristics in the CAWS on the probability of invasive Asian carp eDNA detection in the CAWS from 2009 to 2012 was examined. In the CAWS, the direction of stream flow is mostly away from Lake Michigan, though there are infrequent reversals in flow direction towards Lake Michigan during dry spells. We find that the flow reversal volume into the Lake has a statistically significant positive relationship with eDNA detection probability, while other covariates, like gage height, precipitation, season, water temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, pH and chlorophyll concentration do not. This suggests that stream flow direction is highly influential on eDNA detection in the CAWS and should be considered when interpreting eDNA evidence. We also find that the beta-binomial regression model provides a stronger fit for eDNA detection probability compared to a binomial regression model. This paper provides a statistical modeling framework for interpreting eDNA sampling evidence and for evaluating covariates influencing eDNA detection. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",yes

Using electro-olfactogram recording (EOG), we found that the olfactory system of this species is acutely sensitive to three F-series prostaglandins (PGFs) at picomolar concentrations and that this sensitivity is enhanced when juveniles are masculinized using androgens, consistent with expectations of a sex pheromone. Individual PGFs had behavioral activity but it was low, suggesting a mixture might be important. To pursue this possibility, we implanted carps with osmotic pumps containing prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α), a treatment previously shown to elicit release of a PGF-based spawning pheromone in the Common Carp. We found that PGF2α-implanted Silver Carp released a species-specific odor that contained a blend of PGF2α and two of its metabolites, which masculinized individuals detected and were attracted to with high sensitivity. Finally, we found that a mixture of these PGFs was attractive to masculinized Silver Carp, while a different mixture released by Bighead Carp was not. We conclude that Silver Carp likely use a species-specific PGF2α-derived sex pheromone that is probably released at spawning and might be useful in its control. Confirmatory studies that explore pheromone function in naturally mature Silver Carp using natural odors in the field should now be conducted to further confirm our proof-of-concept study.",yes

Using boat-mounted cameras, we recorded video of invasive Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix in the field as they were leaping from the water and measured their leap height, horizontal distance, and angle of escape and estimated their escape velocity. Leap characteristics, fish morphometrics, and environmental data were measured from populations of carp in Mississippi, Missouri, and Illinois. The means for leap height and distance (+/- SE) across all of the study areas were 125 +/- 5.54 and 209 +/- 9.10 cm, respectively. The maximum leap height that was recorded was 276.08 cm (in Ramsey Creek, Missouri), and the maximum distance was 482.34 cm (in DeSoto Lake, Mississippi), both more than double the mean values. The majority of carp (66.1%) leaped at angles between 46 degrees and 65 degrees. The mean water escape velocities (WEV) varied across the three study sites. The velocities in Missouri, 628.4 +/- 31.6 cm/s, were significantly higher than they were in Mississippi, 471.2 +/- 16.9 cm/s or in Illinois, 551.7 +/- 20.6 cm/s. The maximum measured escape velocity was 771 cm/s, but the maximum estimated WEV was substantially higher at 1,280 cm/s. Larger Silver Carp were captured at lower latitudes: 54.79 +/- 0.74 cm in Illinois, 60.86 +/- 0.75 cm in Missouri, and 73.09 +/- 1.03 cm in Mississippi. A regression analysis indicated that leap distance and height were correlated with fish size, escape velocity, and angle of escape and that escape velocity was correlated with streamflow velocity, fish size, and water temperature. This study provides a first-time quantification of the leap characteristics and escape velocities of Silver Carp, which we believe approximates their maximum burst swim speeds. Therefore, these data can be used to develop or refine effective vertical and hydraulic barriers to the dispersal of Silver Carp. The data also demonstrate that the leaping and high-speed swimming capabilities of Silver Carp are greater than has been assumed previously.",yes

Management of any species relies on an accurate understanding of population characteristics and dynamics. However, Silver Carp seasonal sampling variation is unknown. Sampling during periods of peak catch rates would facilitate Silver Carp assessment and management, improving monitoring and removal techniques. The objective of this study was to evaluate adult Silver Carp seasonal sampling variation with boat electroshocking and trammel nets. Silver Carp were collected monthly (April-October) during 2014 and 2015 from four locations in the Des Moines River, Iowa. Trammel nets rarely captured Silver Carp (mean +/- SE = 4.9 +/- 1.6 fish/net; 60% of fish were captured in 6.3% of net sets) and therefore were not included in analyses. Electroshocking catch rates (CPUEs) exhibited a bimodal distribution, with peak CPUEs generally occurring in May, June, and September and lower catch rates observed during July and August. Catch rates were positively related to river discharge at upstream sites but not at downstream sites. Silver Carp size structure was similar among months and sites except at Cliffland, where fish were smaller during August and October compared to earlier in the year. Finally, Silver Carp condition peaked during April and May and decreased throughout the year except at Keokuk, where peaks were observed during both May and August. Although spatiotemporal variability was substantial, these results suggest that sampling of Silver Carp via electroshocking in May-June and September-October generally produces higher catch rates compared to July-August sampling and generates a more representative size structure. Using site-specific knowledge, monitoring and surveillance programs could more effectively sample during these periods of high vulnerability and densities in order to manage the spread and impacts of Silver Carp at statewide and regionwide scales.",yes

Herein, we investigated recruitment synchrony of Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix across the Mississippi River basin. Year-class strength (YCS) and synchrony of nine populations (maximum linear distance=806.4km) were indexed using catch-curve residuals correlated between sites and related to local and regional climatic conditions. Overall, Silver Carp YCS was not synchronous among populations, suggesting that local environmental factors are more important determinants of YCS than large-scale environmental factors. Variation in Silver Carp YCS was influenced by river base flow and discharge variability at each site, indicating that extended periods of static local discharge benefit YCS. Furthermore, river discharge and air temperature were correlated and synchronized among sites, butonly similarities in river discharge were correlated with Silver Carp population synchrony, indicating thatsimilarities in discharge (i.e., major flood) among sites can positively synchronize Silver Carp YCS. The positivecorrelation between Silver Carp YCS and river discharge synchrony suggests that regional flood regimes are an important force determining the degree of population synchrony among Mississippi River Silver Carp populations.",yes

There were two objectives for this investigation: (a) to estimate correlations among population characteristics and the influence of latitude and the time since first detection, and (b) to model the influence of river discharge and temperature on growth early in life to age 3. We estimated spatial variability in silver carp population characteristics and dynamics from nine sites across the UMR and assessed if biotic, abiotic or invasion-related (time since first detection) variables influence spatial patterns. Silver carp body weight, size structure, annual mortality, and growth parameters varied among locations. Silver carp recruitment was less stable for populations with higher relative abundance estimates and where carp were first detected >= 20 years ago whereas maximum carp age decreased with increasing latitude. Although model selection indicated silver carp length at age 3 was associated with mean daily discharge (m(3)/s) coefficient of variation, mean May-June temperatures, and ordinal date of maximum discharge, parameter coefficients and effect sizes were small and not biologically meaningful. Our results suggest that silver carp populations are governed by intraspecific mechanisms, but time-dependent changes in populations may partially underpin heterogeneity across populations.

The critical and burst swimming speed of each species at two individual length groups (1.0–5.0 cm, 5.1–9.0 cm) was significantly different (p < 0.05), and the water velocities in fish passage should be less than the fish burst swimming speed.

Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix Valenciennes in Cuvier & Valenciennes, 1844), an invasive planktivorous fish, has spread throughout Midwestern rivers and currently threatens the Great Lakes. Because silver carp remove plankton and other particles from the water column, they may compete with mussels for food resources. This would be among the first examples of a direct competitive interaction between fish and mussels. To examine the potential for competition, a 30 day tank experiment was performed with 2 year old fatmucket mussels (Lampsilis siliquoidea Barnes, 1823) and age-1 silver carp in three treatments: fatmucket only, silver carp only and fatmucket + silver carp. All tanks were given a commercial algal-based diet daily and dry mass of suspended particles (an estimate of available food) and NH4, NO3 and NO2 concentrations were quantified every 5 days to track food availability and changes in nutrients. Initial and final silver carp total length (mm) and mass (g), and fatmucket length (mm), height (mm) and surface area (cm(2)) were measured. Survival was 100% over the test duration for both species. Fatmucket grew less in the fatmucket + silver carp treatment, whereas silver carp growth was undetectable regardless of treatment. Fatmucket also exhibited increased movement in the presence of silver carp. Suspended particles did not differ among treatments. Dissolved nitrogen concentrations were higher in the silver carp treatments, suggesting that silver carp increase nutrient availability in aquatic systems. Overall, the slower growth rates observed in the fatmucket + silver carp treatment compared with the mussel-only treatment suggest exploitative competition between invasive planktivorous silver carp and fatmucket, and this competition may contribute to additional stress on already imperilled mussels.",yes

Broadband sound recorded from an outboard motor (100 hp at 32 km/hr) can modulate their behavior in captivity; however, the response of wild silver carp to broadband sound has yet to be determined. In this experiment, broadband sound (0.06-10 kHz) elicited jumping behavior from silver carp in the Spoon River near Havana, IL independent of boat movement, indicating acoustic stimulus alone is sufficient to induce jumping. Furthermore, the number of jumping fish decreased with subsequent sound exposures. Understanding silver carp jumping is not only important from a behavioral standpoint, it is also critical to determine effective techniques for controlling this harmful species, such as herding fish into a net for removal.",yes

These fish are well known for their airborne leaps in response to passing watercraft, but the trigger for, and functional significance of jumping remains unknown. The behavior of wild silver carp responding to moving (16, 24, 32, and 40 km/hr) 6 m aluminum boats equipped with 4-stroke outboard motors (100 or 150 hp) was quantified. Experiments were conducted at three sites on the Illinois River near Havana, IL and most boat transits (57.9%) stimulated five or more fish to jump. The frequency of jumping (fish/min) w as independent of speed and motor type and the vast majority of fish (> 90.0%) jumped after the boat had passed their position but avoided the area directly astern (< 4.0 m). Furthermore, 79.8% of fish vectored away from the moving watercraft. The results suggest that jumping direction is not random and fish can localize the stimulus source. The “delayed” jumping until after the boat had transited the area indicates that the trigger may be turbulence and/or higher sound pressure levels. This is the first study to model silver carp jumping in response to motorized watercraft and can aid fisheries managers in predicting the direction and location of airborne fish to develop effective herding and capture methods.",yes

Bigmouth buffalo occupied a small trophic niche and had the greatest trophic overlap with silver carp (93.6%) and bighead carp (94.1%) followed by gizzard shad (91.0%). Paddlefish had a trophic niche which relied on some resources different from those used by other species, and therefore had the lowest trophic overlap with bigheaded carp and other two native fish. The trophic overlap by bigheaded carp onto native fish was typically stronger than the reverse effects from native fish.

Severe hypoxia stress can lead to damage and even death of silver carp. Therefore, it is very important to explore how silver carp adapt to and respond to hypoxia stress. MicroRNAs play an important role in a series of important life activities in organisms. In this study, the differentiallyexpressed miRNAs were screened from a mixed pool of liver, brain, heart and gill of silver carp under different levels of hypoxia stress by high-throughput sequencing. Our findings provided new insights to further study the miRNA regulatory mechanism and molecular characteristics of anoxic response in silver carp. Hypoxia is one of the serious stresses in fish culture, which can lead to physical and morphological changes, and cause injury and even death to fish. Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) is an important economic fish and widely distributed in China. MicroRNA is a kind of endogenous non-coding single-stranded small RNA, which is involved in cell development, and immune response and gene expression regulation. In this study, silver carp were kept in the closed containers for hypoxia treatment by spontaneous oxygen consumption. The samples of heart, brain, liver and gill were collected, and the total RNAs extracted separately from the four tissues were mixed in equal amounts according to the concentration. Afterwards, the RNA pool was constructed for high-throughput sequencing, and based on the small RNA sequencing, the differentially expressed microRNAs were identified. Furthermore, their target gene prediction and enrichment analyses were carried out. The results showed that a total of 229 known miRNAs and 391 putative novel miRNAs were identified, which provided valuable resources for further study on the regulatory mechanism of miRNAs in silver carp under hypoxia stress. The authors verified 16 differentially expressed miRNAs by qRT-PCR, and the results were consistent with small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq). The predicted target genes number of differentially expressed miRNAs was 25,146. GO and KEGG functional enrichment analysis showed that these target genes were mainly involved in the adaption of hypoxia stress in silver carp through biological regulation, catalytic activity and apoptosis.

This genetic map spans a length of 2,721.07 cM with 3,134 SNPs distributed on 24 linkage groups (LGs). Comparative genomic mapping presented a high level of syntenic relationship between silver carp and zebrafish. We detected one major and nineteen suggestive QTL for 4 growth-related traits (body length, body height, head length and body weight) at 6, 12 and 18 months post hatch (mph), explaining 10.2 similar to 19.5% of phenotypic variation. All six QTL for growth traits of 12 mph generally overlapped with QTL for 6 mph, while the majority of QTL for 18 mph were identified on two additional LGs, which may reveal a different genetic modulation during early and late muscle growth stages. Four potential candidate genes were identified from the QTL regions by homology searching of marker sequences against zebrafish genome. Hepcidin, a potential candidate gene identified from a QTL interval on LG16, was significantly associated with growth traits in the analyses of both phenotype-SNP association and mRNA expression between small-size and large-size groups of silver carp.

Therefore, understanding their reproductive traits and particularly in the context of hybridization with other cyprinids was of value to explain their rapid propagation as well as potential benefits for aquaculture due to their unique diet, behavior, growth potential, and tolerance to deteriorating environmental conditions in freshwater ecosystems. Distant hybridization is an effective tool to create different ploidy offspring with changed phenotypes and genotypes. In this study, we reported distant hybridization of female koi carp (Cyprinus carpio haematopterus, KOC, 2n = 100) x male bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, BIC, 2n = 48) and the spontaneous occurrence of two new crucian"" carp-like homodiploid fish (2nGCC-L; 2nCCC-L; 2n = 100), a new type of triploid hybrid (3nKB, 3n = 124), and a new type of tetraploid hybrid (4nKB, 4n = 148). The body color of 2nGCC-L and 2nCCC-L were gray and multicolor, respectively. Both phenotypes were similar to the crucian carp (Carassius auratus). The difference was that their heads were rounder than those of the crucian carp and they had higher backs. Compared with the KOC with two pairs of barbels and BIC without barbel, 2nGCC-L, 2nCCC-L, and 4nKB had no barbel, but 3nKB had one pair of barbels. Microsatellite patterns and 5S rDNA sequences confirmed that 2nGCC-L, 2nCCC-L, and 3nKB were of hybrid origin. In regard to feeding, KOC was omnivorous and BIC was a typical filter-feeder.

However, there is a paucity of information concerning Silver Carp in the Missouri River basin, especially in tributaries. Little is known about how Silver Carp function in these tributaries or how connectivity with a main-stem river can influence population demographics within either system. The Kansas River is a tributary to the Missouri River and has multiple physical anthropogenic barriers creating varying levels of connectivity within the system, as well as with the Missouri River. These varying levels of connectivity, or lack thereof, provide a unique opportunity to examine population demographics in river segments separated by barriers. We collected Silver Carp from upstream and downstream of the first two barriers on the Kansas River in the summers of 2018 and 2019. No Silver Carp were captured upstream of a hydropower dam at river kilometer 84 but were found upstream of a water diversion weir at river kilometer 24. Catch rates of adult Silver Carp were lower in the reach above the weir, but Silver Carp caught in this reach exhibited greater growth rates than Silver Carp captured below the weir. Catch rates of juveniles were also lower in the reach above the weir. Limited connectivity within the Kansas River via the water diversion weir could influence size structure and catch rates of Silver Carp captured above and below the weir. Lack of juveniles above the weir indicates that reproduction may be limited in this reach, and river conditions below the weir may be more suitable for rearing juvenile Silver Carp. This information is important for understanding Silver Carp population demographics across a range of river environments, providing critical information for the development and implementation of broadscale control plans.",yes

Therefore, susceptibility of a habitat to invasion is influenced by the capacity of native predators to regulate invasive species through consumption. Closely related predators often share similar characteristics (e.g., odors or body morphometry), and prey species capable of expressing generalized behavioral responses to predators with similar characteristics may increase their chances for survival. Here, we examined how naive juvenile silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), an invasive Asian carp, respond to three predator odors from predators commonly found in Midwestern lakes and rivers of the USA. We tested two congeneric species of bass (largemouth Micropterus salmoides and smallmouth M. dolomieu bass) and one outgroup, longnose gar (Lepisosteus osseus). Additionally, we tested how silver carp conditioned to recognize the odor of one group, largemouth bass, responded to the predator odors of the congeneric species and the outgroup. We found that juvenile silver carp showed no innate response to any of the three predator odors. Additionally, although they could be conditioned to recognize predator odors from largemouth bass, they were unable to generalize predator odors to smallmouth bass or longnose gar odor. These results suggest that invasive species could be less likely to persist in environments with diverse predator communities than environments of equal densities with uniform predator communities and that future studies should continue to explore this area as well as focus on understanding dynamics in predator-prey interactions of invasive species.",yes

Juvenile Silver Carp can and do occur in great numbers after a successful spawn. These massive schools of small Silver Carp seem to be an obvious prey source for the common predators of the Mississippi River system. The level to which native piscivores are consuming this novel prey item is unclear. Therefore, the goal of this research was to assess the diets of native piscivores collected in Pool 26 and the Open River reach of the Mississippi River. Using diet contents and catch rates of small fishes, selection or avoidance could be determined for predator prey interactions. Then a controlled laboratory experiment was conducted to determine if common predators [White Bass Morone chrysops and Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede, 1802)] would select for or against this novel prey in the presence of two native prey fish [Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum (Lesueur, 1818) and Emerald Shiner Notropis atherinoides]. Understanding how predator-prey interactions occur in a controlled laboratory experiment may provide insight to trends observed in the field. The majority of native piscivores appeared to be avoiding Silver Carp in both reaches and selecting native prey fishes. The order in which prey fish were consumed by both predators showed significant avoidance of Silver Carp. It appears that the trends observed in the field were supported by our controlled laboratory experiment. The effectiveness of different native piscivores to consume Silver Carp may have impacts on future management decisions.",yes

Trophic biomagnification was for Cu, Fe and Zn, but not for Cr, Ni, As, Pb and Cd. Concentrations of As in 15 muscle samples (3.7%) from Taihu Lake Basin exceeded the guidelines (1.0 mg/kg, wet mass) provided by FAO/WHO (2014), while the total target hazard quotient (TTHQ) values were <1.0, indicating no obvious non-carcinogenic risks to humans that consume those fishes. However, people who consume larger amounts of fish products, or people who are vulnerable, such as pregnant women, children and people with poor health, might be at greater risk.

However, the impacts of elevated temperature on fish reproduction are diverse in different regions. Previous studies have revealed that the spawning timing of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) in the Pearl River, in China, has changed over the past decade. However, few studies have explored the potential reasons, which are critical for determining fishing-moratorium periods and developing sustainable fisheries. The current study used discharge suitability index (DSI), temperature suitability index (TSI), correlation and time-series analyses to determine (i) the optimal discharge and temperature for silver carp spawning; (ii) relationships among the thermal regime, hydrological parameters, and spawning timing based on an 11-year time-series dataset. Our results indicated that the most suitable discharge and temperature for silver carp spawning were 13,000-15,000 m(3)/s and 25-26 degrees C, respectively. The start date of spawning fluctuated with a slight tendency to delay, while the spawning peak and end date obviously occurred earlier during the study period. Correlation analyses suggested that the increasing average temperature between January and March likely caused the initial spawning delay. Moreover, elevated temperatures in August and September probably promoted the anticipated end of silver carp spawning. However, increases in discharge did not significantly correlate with the start of spawning but were significantly and positively correlated with the spawning peak. These results indicated that elevated temperatures shorten the spawning period of silver carp in the Pearl River. Moreover, the initial spawning of silver carp seems to be triggered by temperature rather than changes in discharge; flow pulses can probably create more suitable spawning niches for H. molitrix. This study enhances our understanding of the effect of warming on fish reproduction in subtropical regions.</p>",yes

Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (H. nobilis) were used to explore the responses of trophic levels of the filter-feeding fish to seasonal variations of food resources. Combined stable isotopic analysis and dietary analysis revealed that filter-feeding fish tended to have a higher trophic level in spring (May) and autumn (September and October). This may result from the abundant density of food resources (zooplankton and phytoplankton) and fish flexible foraging strategy, as we predicted that the trophic level follows the seasonality of food availability. Pearson’ correlation analysis and a structural equation model showed that seasonal variation of total phosphorus and water temperature could indirectly affect trophic levels of silver carp and bighead carp by mediating the abundance of phytoplankton and zooplankton directly and indirectly along the food chain.

The flow separation zone near the confluence of a river network is a favorite habitat and feeding place for silver carp, which is one of the four major species of Chinese carp and usually provides positive rheotaxis to water flow. In the current study, a series of laboratory experiments were done to determine the behavioral responses of juvenile silver carp to the hydrodynamic forces near the separation zone of a channel confluence. The locomotion and trajectory of juvenile silver carp were recorded by infrared thermal imaging, while the flow velocity field near the separation zone was measured by a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system. A total of 60 juvenile silver carp were released near the separation zone among which 40 carp swam in the upstream direction. Amongst them, 24 carp swam to the tributary and the remaining 16 swam into the main channel. Almost all these 24 carp travelled initially along the boundary of the separation zone near the corner, where flow shear was strongest, and then swam to the tributary. Instead of avoiding zones of strong vorticity, they chose and followed a trajectory along which the flow vorticity was large. On encountering these vortical flows, they increased the tail beat frequency and decreased the tail-beat amplitude to maintain body stability. These observations provide important knowledge on locomotion of fish near river confluences and are beneficial for the fish habitat protection.

We quantified the uncertainty of the potential AC effects by coupling the EwE model with estimates of parameter uncertainty in AC production, consumption, and predator diets obtained using structured expert judgment. Our model projected mean +/- SD AC equilibrium biomass ranging from 52 +/- 34 to 104 +/- 75 kg/ha under the different scenarios. Relative to baseline simulations without AC, AC invasion under all detrital diet scenarios decreased the biomass of most fish and zooplankton groups. The effects of AC in the HP scenario were similar to those in the detrital diet scenarios except that the biomasses of most Walleye and Yellow Perch groups were greater under HP because these fishes were buffered from competition with AC by increased productivity at lower trophic levels. Asian carp predation on Walleye and Yellow Perch larvae caused biomass declines among all Walleye and Yellow Perch groups. Large food web impacts of AC occurred in only 2% of the simulations, where AC biomass exceeded 200 kg/ha, resulting in biomass declines of zooplankton and planktivorous fish near the levels observed in the Illinois River. Our findings suggest that AC would affect Lake Erie's food web by competing with other planktivorous fishes and by providing additional prey for piscivores.

Data analysis using Bayesian mixing model showed that SC was more like a fine particulate organic matter (fPOM) feeder, while BC consumed more coarse particulate organic matter (cPOM) and displayed a higher trophic position in both reservoirs. In contrast, niche breadths represented by the corrected standard ellipse area (SEA(C)) were essentially the same for SC and BC in Nanwan (SEA(C) = 6.1 for SC and BC), but much larger for silver carp in Nianyushan (SEA(C) for SC: 11.6, SEA(C) for BC: 4.2). The high stocking ratio of SC/BC in Nianyushan was the probable reason for the large SEA(C) of silver carp, which suggested that silver carp could use more food resources and become more competitive with a higher stocking biomass ratio. The results indicated that the trophic partitioning of filter feeders might be regulated by the stocking biomass ratio of the fish to some extent.",yes

In this study, an investigation was conducted for significant fungal infections of 12 species of fish in four regions in Xinjiang, China, to understand the distribution of local fish fungal pathogens. Twenty-six fungal strains with pathogenicity were isolated, and the challenge experiment showed that eight strains from Changji area had high infection rate to fish eggs. Based on internal transcribed spacer sequence data and molecular analysis, the 26 strains were classified into nine different species of six fungal genera. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all strains were divided into two clades, namely Cluster 1 (contains only the genus Mucor) and Cluster 2 (consists of five small branches), and the distribution of strains from the same region was scattered in two clusters. There is no strict host selectivity for these fungi to infect fish. Mucor sp. are the main fungal pathogen of fish in these four regions, whereas Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Carassius auratus are two types of fish that were susceptible to pathogen. In addition, the environmental adaptability experiments showed that eight highly pathogenic strains have different adaptability to the environment, and their optimum temperature and pH were 25 degrees C and 7.0, respectively, whereas the concentration of NaCl was negatively correlated with the growth of strains. Therefore, these results indicated that the coinfection of multiple fungal pathogens in a culture region should be considered in the future study.",yes

Based on the high-quality genome sequences and previous genome sequencing projects, a number of genes that were probably subject to positive selection reside in the genome of H. molitrix, and the last common ancestors of H. molitrix and H. nobilis were identified. Some of these genes may partially explain the mechanisms of H. molitrix for surviving damage due to toxic algae. Demographic history estimation suggests that the effective population size (EPS) of the species may have constantly increased along with the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, started to decline when quaternary glaciation started, and further declined during the Younger Dryas Period.

Ichthyoplankton monitoring along the Illinois Waterway (IWW) has provided information on abundances of Asian carp eggs in the IWW's navigation pools. Post-fertilization times derived from egg development stages and water temperatures can be used to estimate spawning times of Asian carp eggs, but estimating how far these eggs have drifted requires information on river hydraulics. A Fluvial Egg Drift Simulator (FluEgg) program was designed to predict the drift of Asian carp eggs in the riverine environment with egg growth considered. This paper presents a reverse-time particle tracking (RTPT) algorithm for back-casting the spawning location of eggs from their collection site. The RTPT algorithm was implemented as a module in FluEgg. The new version of FluEgg was coupled with an unsteady hydrodynamic model of the IWW to predict the spawning locations for 530 eggs that were collected in June 2015. The results indicate that tailwater sections below the Locks and Dams (L&Ds) in each navigation pool appear to be preferred spawning locations for Silver Carp (a species of Asian carp).

BigheadHypophthalmichthys nobilisand Silver CarpH. molitrix, collectively 'bigheaded carps' (BHC), are planktivorous fishes threatening to invade Lake Michigan. While previous studies indicate the lake contains habitat suitable for BHC growth, there is a need to understand how anthropogenic-driven changes to the abiotic and biotic environment could alter its vulnerability to BHC. We applied a spatially explicit model of BHC growth rate potential (GRP; g g(-1)d(-1)) to nine biophysical model scenarios to evaluate changes in habitat suitability in Lake Michigan. Scenarios differed in meteorology (cool, reference, warm), annual tributary phosphorus loads (0, 3300, and 5600 MTA), and the presence/absence of invasive dreissenid mussels. Mussel effects on BHC GRP relied on their contact with the surface mixed layer (SML), the depth of which was affected by meteorology. The warm year advanced the expansion of Bighead Carp habitat by increasing temperature-dependent foraging rates and lessening the time of competitive interaction with mussels due to earlier stratification separating mussels from the SML. Phosphorus loads were the most influential driver of the lake's suitability. Compared to present conditions, we estimate BHC could have grown an additional 8-40% annually in the 1980s when mussels were not in the lake and phosphorus loads were higher. Our study demonstrates how climate change and nutrient enrichment can increase Lake Michigan's vulnerability to BHC by affecting thermal regime and productivity, thereby limiting negative effects of dreissenid mussels on BHC growth.",yes

Resilience, the ability of an ecosystem to recover after perturbation, was observed at local scales and within some taxa but has yet to manifest at a river-wide scale and often co-varied with abiotic environmental or seasonal factors.

To understand how regime shifts may apply to floodplain-river ecosystems, we synthesize our understanding of ecosystem dynamics using an alternate regimes conceptual framework. We present three plausible sets of alternate regimes relevant to natural resource management interests within the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois River. These alternate regimes include: 1) a clear water and abundant vegetation regime vs. a turbid water and sparse vegetation regime in lentic, off-channel areas, 2) a diverse native fish community regime vs. an invasive-dominated fish community regime, and 3) a regime characterized by a diverse and dynamic mosaic of floodplain vegetation types vs. one characterized as a persistent invasive wet meadow monoculture. For each set of potential alternate regimes, we review available literature to synthesize known or hypothesized feedback mechanisms that reinforce regimes, controlling variables that drive regime transitions, and current restoration pathways. Our conceptual models provide preliminary support for the existence of alternate regimes in floodplain-river ecosystems. Quantitatively testing hypotheses contained within the conceptual model are important next steps in evaluating the model.

Contracted removal was effective for suppressing small populations at the edge of the range but cannot support a market. “Fisher-side” removals totaled 225,372 kg in one year. However, participation was low, perhaps due to reporting requirements for fishers. The “market-side”, set-quota approach removed >1.3 million kg of bigheaded carp in less than 6 months. Larger, older fish were disproportionately harvested, which may hinder the ability to suppress population growth. Total density declined in one river reach, and harvest may reduce upstream movement toward the invasion fronts. With sufficient market demand, harvest may control bigheaded carp.

The age and growth of Bigheaded Carp in recently established populations, especially in this region, are poorly characterized. Therefore, we compared the age and growth of bigheaded carp for four low-density navigation pools of the Mississippi River near the invasion front with one long-established high-density population, separated by LD19. To assess growth rates and age at maturity, we estimated consensus age from pectoral spines, postcleithra, and vertebrae from 1229 bigheaded carp, 30 fish per 50 mm size class. Length at age of capture and back-calculated length-at-age were used to create growth curves using VBGC analysis. The analysis indicated higher growth rates of bighead carp and silver carp upstream of Lock and Dam 19 than downstream. Comparison of growth models with a likelihood ratio test indicated differences in length at time zero between the pools for bighead carp but not for silver carp.

Bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) are Asian cyprinids that have been widely introduced and are considered undesirable and detrimental invasive species in many parts of their introduced range. The relatively novel “Judas fish” technique is used to locate aggregations of fish in the wild by strategically releasing individuals equipped with surgically implanted transmitters. However, releasing Judas fish that are capable of reproducing is problematic because it could add to the invasion problem by contributing to recruitment if not recaptured. We thus tested whether surgical ligation and division of the ductus deferens could effectively sterilize adult diploid bighead and grass carp. If effective, surgical sterilization would result in a superior Judas fish by maintaining the reproductive motivation derived from intact gonads while blocking the reproductive potential. This technique was initially successful, but ultimately most individuals were able to recanalize the surgically-severed ducts and produce milt, and were thus potentially able to reproduce during the following spawning season. Thus, ligation and division of the ductus deferens does not seem to be a viable procedure to sterilize bighead carp or grass carp for deployment as Judas fish where long term sterility of the fish is paramount in importance.",yes

Therefore, uncovering the genetic mechanisms underlying hypoxia adaptation and tolerance in fish prior to any genetic improvement is essential. Bighead carp is one of the most important freshwater fish species in aquaculture worldwide; however, this species does not have a strong ability to tolerate hypoxia. In this study, the dissolved oxygen level (0.6 mg/L) was maintained above the asphyxiation point of bighead carp for a long time to simulate hypoxia stress. The liver, gills, and heart were sampled before (0 h) and after (1 h, 2 h, 4 h) the hypoxia tests. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the liver were significantly (p < 0.05) elevated at 1 h after hypoxic stress. By observing tissue morphology, the cell structure of the liver and gill tissues was found to change to varying degrees before and after hypoxia stress. Transcriptome sequencing was performed on 36 samples of gill, liver, and heart at four time points, and a total of 293.55G of data was obtained. In the early phase (0−1 h), differentially expressed genes (DEGs, 807 genes upregulated, 654 genes downregulated) were mainly enriched in signal transduction, such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions and ECM-receptor interactions. In the middle phase (0−2 h), DEGs (1201 genes upregulated and 2036 genes downregulated) were mainly enriched in regulation and adaptation, such as the MAPK and FoxO signaling pathways. Finally, in the later phase (0-4 h), DEGs (3975 genes upregulated and 4412 genes downregulated) were mainly enriched in tolerance and apoptosis, such as the VEGF signaling pathway and apoptosis. The genes with the most remarkable upregulation at different time points in the three tissues had some similarities. Genetic differences in these genes may be responsible for the differences in hypoxia tolerance among individuals. Altogether, our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of hypoxia adaptation in fish. Further, the key regulatory genes identified provide genetic resources for breeding hypoxia-tolerant bighead carp species.",yes

Due to the inefficient conversion of food into fish tissue, large portions of consumed materials are egested and shunted to benthic habitats. We explored how bighead carp alter pools of organic matter between planktonic and benthic habitats, and across ecosystem boundaries. Here, we report evidence from a manipulative experiment demonstrating that bighead carp greatly reapportion pools of organic matter from planktonic to benthic habitats to such a degree that additional effects propagated across ecological boundaries into terrestrial ecosystems. Strong direct consumption by bighead carp reduced filamentous algae, biomass and production of zooplankton, and production of a native planktivorous fish within planktonic habitats. Reduced herbivory indirectly increased phytoplankton (chlorophyll a). Direct consumption of organic matter by bighead carp supported high carp production and concomitant losses of materials due to egestion. Perhaps in response to organic matter subsidies provided by fish egestion, ponds having bighead carp had higher standing crop biomass of Chironomidae larvae, as well as cross-boundary fluxes of their adult life stage. In contrast, we detected reduced cross-boundary fluxes of adult Chaoboridae midges in ponds having bighead carp. Consideration of bighead carp as mediators of organic matter exchanges provides a clearer framework for predicting the direct and extended impacts of these invasive planktivores in freshwater ecosystems.

We present an optimization-based approach for prioritizing dam mitigations to restore habitat connectivity for native fish species, while limiting invasive species spread. Our methodology is tested with a case study involving 240 dams in the Upper Mississippi River, USA. We integrate six native migratory fish species distribution models, distributions of two invasive fishes, and estimated costs for dam removal and construction of fish passes. Varying budgets and post-mitigation fish passage rates are analyzed for two scenarios: ‘no invasives’ where non-selective mitigations (e.g., dam removal) are used irrespective of potential invasive species habitat gains and ‘invasives’ where a mixture of selective (e.g., lift-and-sort fish passage) and non-selective mitigations are deployed to limit invasive species range expansion. To achieve the same overall habitat connectivity gains, we find that prioritizations accounting for invasive species are 3 to 6 times more costly than those that do not. Habitat gains among native fish species were highly variable based on potential habitat overlap with invasive species and post-mitigation passabilities, ranging from 0.4–58.9% (‘invasives’) and 7.9–95.6% (‘no invasives’) for a $50M USD budget. Despite challenges associated with ongoing nonnative fish invasions, opportunities still exist to restore connectivity for native species as indicated by individual dams being frequently selected in both scenarios across varying passabilities and budgets, however increased restoration costs associated with invasive species control indicates the importance of limiting their further spread within the basin. Given tradeoffs in managing for native vs. invasive species in river systems worldwide, our approach demonstrates strategies for identifying a portfolio of candidate barriers that can be investigated further for their potential to enhance native fish habitat connectivity while concurrently limiting invasive species dispersal.",yes

Additionally, differences in the behaviour of hybrids may lead to deleterious ecosystem effects that compound any negative impacts of the invading parental species. Invasive silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) provide an opportunity to evaluate how hybridisation may influence the behaviour, dispersal, and spread of an invasive species introgressive complex. In order to investigate the role hybrids may have in the invasion ecology of bigheaded carps, we examined the distribution, movements, and environmental cues for movement of two invasive fishes and their hybrids in the Illinois River (U.S.A.). Early generation hybrids (e.g. F-1,F-2, and first-generation backcross individuals) composed a greater proportion of the population at the invasion front where abundances of bigheaded carp were low. A greater proportion of early hybrids passed through dams upstream towards the invasion front than did other hybrids and parental species. The movements and environmental cues for movement of late-generation backcrosses (more genetically similar to parental genotype) were not different from the parental species with which they shared the most alleles. Although the direction of the relationship between movement and environment was sometimes different for the parental species and associated advanced generation hybrids, these results indicate that management for parental species will also affect most hybrids. Although early generation hybrids are rare, our results indicate they may disperse towards low-density population zones (i.e. invasion fronts) or are produced at greater frequency in low-density areas. These rare hybrids have the potential to produce a variety of unique genetic combinations that could result in more rapid adaptation of a non-native population to their invaded range potentially facilitating the establishment of invasive species.",yes

Acoustic telemetry data were used to parameterize multistate models to examine the spatial dynamics of bigheaded carps in the Illinois River to (1) evaluate the effects of existing dams on movement, (2) identify how individuals distribute among pools, and (3) gauge the effects of reductions in movement towards the invasion front. Multistate models estimated that movement was generally less likely among upper river pools (Starved Rock, Marseilles, and Dresden Island) than the lower river (La Grange and Peoria) which matched the pattern of gated versus wicket style dams. Simulations using estimated movement probabilities indicated that Bighead Carp accumulate in La Grange Pool while Silver Carp accumulate in Alton Pool. Fewer Bighead Carp reached the upper river compared to Silver Carp during simulations. Reducing upstream movement probabilities (e.g., reduced propagule pressure) by75% into any of the upper river pools could reduce upper river abundance with similar results regardless of location.

Use (residency and passages) of Swan Lake by invasive bigheaded carps was monitored using acoustic telemetry (n=50 individuals/species) to evaluate the use of a large, restored habitat from 2004 to 2005. Passages (entrances/exits) by bigheaded carps were highest in winter, and residency was highest in the summer. Bighead carp backwater use was associated with the differences in temperature between the main channel and backwater, and passages primarily occurred between 18:00h and midnight. Silver carp backwater use was positively correlated with water level and main channel discharge, and fewer passages occurred between 12:00h and 18:00h than during any other time of day. Harvest occurring during summer or high main channel discharge could reduce backwater abundances while maintenance of low water levels could reduce overall backwater use.

Risk assessments based on habitat suitability can identify sites most vulnerable to invasion that should be prioritized for preventative actions. Since habitat suitability is the result of interactions between environmental and organismal attributes, analyses should incorporate individual variability in demographics expected in an invasive population. Individual-based models (IBMs) can predict habitat suitability by accounting for interactions between environmental conditions and individual-level variability. We developed an IBM to predict suitability of rivers in the northern United States to the invasive fishes silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (H. nobilis) and explored the projected effects of climate change on habitat suitability. All rivers supported adult survival, although complete survival of all adult demographics and positive growth only occurred in approximately 45% (17 of 38) of rivers for silver carp and 26% (10 of 38) of rivers for bighead carp. Only the largest individuals at the time of introduction survived in rivers where adult mortality occurred. Most rivers were unsuitable for young-of-year (89% and 92% of rivers for silver carp and bighead carp respectively). Climate change simulations had relatively little effect on adult habitat suitability but resulted in up to four times the number of rivers being suitable for young-of-year by the late-21st century and greatly extended the viable spawning season by up to an additional 65 days for silver carp and 77 days for bighead carp.

Invasive species can have varying ecosystem effects and responses to control throughout an invaded range, and removal near invasion fronts may inadvertently alter these characteristics. Bigheaded carp (bighead carp (Hypophthabnichthys nobilis Richardson) and silver carp (H. molitrix Valenciennes)) are invasive fishes from Asia invading North American freshwater ecosystems. We used mobile hydroacoustic surveys to examine bigheaded carp population characteristics from 2012 to 2015 across an invasion gradient in the Illinois River (USA), one of the most likely pathways to the Laurentian Great Lakes. These bigheaded carp species comprised 23-46% of fish community abundance and 45-78% of fish biomass across reaches, with lower contribution near the invasion front where intensive management by harvest occurs. Bigheaded carp prevalence in the community did not differ by habitat and comprised > 50% of community abundance and biomass throughout the river for most size classes. We identified negative relationships between density and relative weight (an index of body condition) of bigheaded carp, suggesting evidence of potential density-dependent intraspecific competition. Efforts to reduce invasive species abundances near invasion fronts may reduce prevalence. However, this could inadvertently release individuals from density-dependent competition and could enhance reproductive potential, growth or movements.

Recruitment is oftentimes determined by conditions experienced during early life, and winter conditions become increasingly influential as species invade north in temperate regions. Bighead Carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and Silver Carp (H. molitrix) have invaded mid-latitudes of North America and threaten to invade farther north. We conducted pond experiments and bioenergetic simulations to: (1) assess the effects of mild winters on juvenile Bighead Carp and Silver Carp at mid-latitudes; (2) determine how conspecific density affects juveniles during mild winters; and, (3) determine effects of increased winter severity at increasing latitudes. Both species displayed high overwinter survival (85%) in pond experiments. Bighead Carp grew in length (mean 2mm) and maintained initial body mass and percent dry mass (index of energy content). Silver Carp maintained initial length and mass and remained in high condition (dry mass). Conspecific densities tested did not affect growth, condition, or survival. Simulations suggest juvenile Bighead Carp could energetically survive the longest, coldest winter simulated (48 degrees latitude); however, energy reserves at the start of winter became increasingly important for survival as latitude increased. Bighead Carp and Silver Carp recruitment success at mid-latitudes is likely driven by non-winter factors. If these species invade farther north, winter severity may play a stronger role in offspring survival, recruitment, and population dynamics.

However, existing findings mostly demonstrate the effect of TDG on the tolerance of benthic fish in China. Few studies have attached great importance to investigating the impact of TDG supersaturation on pelagic fish. Furthermore, varied flow of flood can lead to varied TDG levels in the spill season. Fish resided in the downstream of high dams may experience a period of chronic exposure at a low TDG level before the arrival of flood peak. However, rare achievement has reported that the survival situation of fish exposed to TDG supersaturated water with a high level after receiving chronic exposure. This study investigates the tolerance of bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) (pelagic fish) to TDG supersaturation and determine the effect of a high level of TDG supersaturation on its survival after chronic TDG exposure. The results showed that TDG led to apparent abnormal behaviours and gas bubble disease signs in bighead carp. The tolerance of bighead carp declined with increasing TDG levels. Compared with the large juvenile bighead carp, the small juvenile bighead carp are more sensitive to TDG. Furthermore, the results indicated that bighead carp subjected to acute exposure after long term chronic exposure are more vulnerable to TDG. The data from this study may provide valuable information related to protecting aquatic organism diversity and establishing water quality standards related to TDG supersaturation. Abstract To assess the effect of TDG on the survival of different sizes of pelagic fish, bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) were subjected to TDG supersaturated water at levels of 125, 130, 135, and 140%. The results showed that apparent abnormal behaviours and symptoms of gas bubble disease (GBD) were observed in bighead carp. The survival probability of large and small juvenile bighead carp declined with increasing TDG levels. The median survival time (ST50) values of large juvenile bighead carp were 74.97 and 31.90 h at 130% and 140% TDG, respectively. While the ST50 of small fish were 22.40 and 6.72 h at the same TDG levels. In comparison to the large juvenile bighead carp, the small juvenile bighead carp showed weaker tolerance to TDG supersaturated water. Furthermore, acute lethality experiments after chronic exposure to TDG were initiated to further investigate the effect of TDG on bighead carp. The juveniles were first subjected to 115% TDG supersaturated water for 96 h. After chronic exposure, live fish were immediately transferred to TDG supersaturated water at levels of 125, 130, 135, and 140%. The results demonstrated that no fish died under chronic exposure and few fish exhibited slight GBD symptoms. The ST50 values for bighead carp subjected to acute exposure after chronic exposure were 61.23 and 23.50 h at 130 and 140%, respectively.

High-intensity light has significant advantages over other behavior deterrents because it can be relatively inexpensive, easy to deploy and can be used in shallow waterways. Although previous studies have shown that light has the potential to guide and block the passage of fishes, the efficacy of light has also been found to be species- and situation-specific, and no study has yet examined how well light works for Bigheaded Carp. The present laboratory study sought to determine whether high-intensity white light might be effective at blocking Bighead Carp (H. nobilis) while having minimal effects on another model fish species. We measured the response of juvenile Bighead Carp and Largemouth Bass (Micropterus sahnoides) to three types of high-intensity white light (constant light [0 Hz] and strobing light [5 Hz or 12 Hz]) in both a dark [1 lux] and a dimly-lit [100 lux] laboratory flume. High-intensity light consistently blocked at least 74% of Bighead Carp in a dark flume, with strobing and constant light having equivalent effects (p > 0.05). In contrast, a constant light (80%) was more effective than a 5 Hz strobing light (33%) in a dimly-lit flume (p < 0.05). While Largemouth Bass were also blocked by constant light (63%) in a dark flume, both a 5 Hz (82%) and 12 Hz (88%) strobing light were more effective (p < 0.05). When tested in a dimly-lit flume, Largemouth Bass were not blocked by either the constant light or a 5 Hz strobing light (p > 0.05). Taken together, our experiments demonstrate that responses to light can be species- and situation-specific, and that high-intensity constant light has particular promise to block Bighead Carp in both dark and dimly-lit environments without strongly blocking bass.

Monitoring this seasonal movement is important for management to control the population size and spread of the species. We examined if environmental DNA (eDNA) approaches could detect seasonal changes of these species. To do this, we developed a novel genetic marker that was able to both detect and differentiate bighead and silver carp DNA. We used the marker, combined with a novel occupancy model, to study the occurrence of bigheaded carps at 3 sites on the Wabash River over the course of a year. We studied the Wabash River because of concerns that carps may be able to use the system to invade the Great Lakes via a now closed (ca. 2017) connection at Eagle Marsh between the Wabash River's watershed and the Great Lakes' watershed. We found seasonal trends in the probability of detection and occupancy that varied across sites. These findings demonstrate that eDNA methods can detect seasonal changes in bigheaded carps densities and suggest that the amount of eDNA present changes seasonally. The site that was farthest upstream and had the lowest carp densities exhibited the strongest seasonal trends for both detection probabilities and sample occupancy probabilities. Furthermore, other observations suggest that carps seasonally leave this site, and we were able to detect this with our eDNA approach.

Our objectives were to assess: (1) the number of mitochondrial haplotypes that were introduced and how they are distributed in North America, which may provide insight into the history of the invasion, (2) how genetic diversity compares between the native Asian and introduced North American populations, (3) how genetic variation is structured across the North American ranges of SC and BHC as well as between the two species, and (4) whether patterns of genetic diversity and structure are likely to affect success of environmental DNA programs for monitoring these species. In both species, we found relatively few mitochondrial haplotypes, and most were present throughout the range. For both SC and BHC, unique haplotypes were found only in a portion of the species' range, possibly indicating the location of additional, more recent introductions. In both species, genetic diversity was moderately lower in North American populations (i.e., 75-90% of that found in Asian populations), but genetic diversity still remained high. We found very little population genetic structure, consistent with a rapidly spreading invasive species, and did not find evidence of cryptic interspecific hybrids. The markers developed for eDNA monitoring will be effective for detecting the majority of individuals of these species in North America.

We used fatty acids to evaluate potential effects of bigheaded carps on taxa from multiple trophic levels in the Upper Mississippi, Illinois, and St. Croix rivers. Seston fatty acid concentrations were highest in the Illinois River lotic sites and connected backwaters and were positively associated with omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids, indicating that these locations had abundant, high-quality basal food resources despite hosting the greatest bigheaded carp densities. Fatty acid profiles of threeridge freshwater mussels tracked the fatty acid values in the seston and were not influenced by bigheaded carp abundances. Hydropsychid caddisflies and bluegill did not differ significantly in total fatty acids or percent lipid among spatial locations, indicating that omnivorous species may be relatively unaffected by bigheaded carps. Gizzard shad, however, exhibited the lowest fatty acid concentrations in the locations with the highest relative bigheaded carp densities, and multivariate models identified bigheaded carp densities as the predictive factor that explained the greatest amount of variability. Zooplankton abundance has been greatly reduced after bigheaded carps' establishment in the Illinois River, which may explain the disconnect between the gizzard shad fatty acids and the plentiful, high-quality phytoplankton in that river.

The eggs, which are believed to perish if they settle before hatching, are slightly denser than water and are held in suspension by water turbulence. It is possible to use egg drift modeling to assess the capability of a river to support the survival of Asian carp eggs. Detection of spawning and estimation of egg abundance in the drift are typically assessed by ichthyoplankton trawls. Correct sampling design and interpretation of trawl data require knowledge of the vertical distribution of eggs in the drift, which can be accomplished with particle transport models. Data that are required to populate models of egg drift and vertical distribution include physical properties of assessed rivers and information on egg size, density, and terminal fall velocity, but data on these egg characteristics have not been previously available. Physical characteristics of the eggs are presented as a function of postfertilization time. We recorded mean egg diameter and terminal fall velocity for eggs from each Asian carp species during the first 5 h of development and at approximately 12 and 22 h postfertilization. Eggs of all species reached their maximum size before 4 h.

We measured ontogenetic changes in routine and maximum swimming speeds of bighead, grass, and silver carp larvae. Daily measurements of routine swimming speed were taken for two weeks post-hatch using a still camera and the LARVEL program, a custom image-analysis software. Larval swimming speed was calculated using larval locations in subsequent image frames and time between images. Using an endurance chamber, we determined the maximum swimming speed of larvae (post-gas bladder inflation) for four to eight weeks post-hatch. For all species, larval swimming speeds showed similar trends with respect to ontogeny: increases in maximum speed, and decreases in routine speed. Maximum speeds of bighead and grass carp larvae were similar and generally faster than silver carp larvae. Routine swimming speeds of all larvae were highest before gas bladder inflation, most likely because gas bladder inflation allowed the fish to maintain position without swimming. Downward vertical velocities of pre-gas bladder inflation fish were faster than upward velocities. Among the three species, grass carp larvae had the highest swimming speeds in the pre-gas bladder inflation period, and the lowest speeds in the post-gas bladder inflation period.

The flow regime alternation of rivers has an impact on the spawning and reproduction conditions of four major Chinese carps in the lower reaches of the Three Gorges Reservoir. To investigate the changes in hydrological conditions and spawning and reproduction performances of four major Chinese carps during their spawning period before and after impoundment of Three Gorges Reservoir, a quantitative analysis of the relevance between such hydrological parameters as flow, water level, sediment concentration and water temperature of Yichang Station and larva runoff of the four species during their spawning period was carried out. As suggested by the results, when four major Chinese carps are spawning, the proper hydrological parameters would be 11,000-15,000 m(3)/s for flow, 43.0-46.0 m for water level, 0.01-0.21 kg/m(3) for sediment concentration and 4-8 d for water rise, and 22-24 degrees C for water temperature. Among those values, water rise and sediment concentration appear to be in significant positive correlation with the larvae abundance of four major Chinese carps, and thus remain critical factors. After the impoundment of Three Gorges Reservoir, the declining trend in flow, water level and water temperature during the spawning period of four major Chinese carps is not significant when compared with that in sediment concentration (by over 98%). The spawning and reproduction time of four species also gets retarded due to the late-coming proper water temperature, so does the spawning scale. The proportions of four carps also change a lot, with silver carp ascending to be at the highest ratio among them.

Bigheaded carps have proliferated throughout the Mississippi River basin, creating an outsized potential for resource competition with native fishes. Studies have showed niche overlap between bigheaded carps and native planktivores is generally high but that overlap varies among rivers. Importantly, niche overlap has not been assessed for density extremes of bigheaded carps within a river to determine whether trophic niches changed as a result of the invasion. The objectives of this study were to determine whether (1) silver and/or bighead carps share a similar isotopic niche with four native planktivores, and (2) that association varies ecologically (i.e., low- and high-densities of bigheaded carps) and spatially (i.e., between rivers). Our results generally show high trophic overlap among species, suggesting potential direct resource competition. Niche overlap was higher in study reaches with low densities of bigheaded carps compared to reaches with high densities, presumably due to intense resource competition and limiting of resources under high densities of bigheaded carps. Across density extremes, trophic reorganization by bigmouth buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus) was divergent from other native planktivores. Species-specific responses may be due to subtle differences in feeding strategies, degree of planktivory, food selectivity, and correlated food size distributions.",yes

Preliminary assessments of spawning potential of Great Lakes tributaries are needed to effectively allocate resources to early-detection programs and more detailed hydrodynamic modelling. Previous preliminary assessments determining the Asian carp spawning potential of tributaries potentially masked temporal variations in stream temperature and velocity. A preliminary assessment was developed that incorporates both the spawning biology of Asian carps and the hydrodynamics of tributaries, based on data at a higher temporal resolution than used previously, to determine the spawning potential of a tributary. The assessment was conducted on eight Lake Ontario tributaries, based on in-situ temperature and velocity data from 2009 to 2014. Two tributaries were found to be suitable using mean data across the assessed time frame; however, inter-annual suitability varied greatly and six tributaries were found to be suitable in at least one of six years over the study period. The assessment highlights previously unexplored inter-annual variation in suitability and provides a method using existing data to identify suitable tributaries for more detailed analyses involving hydrodynamic modelling.

Hydrodynamic modelling can determine if successful hatching of carp eggs can occur in a tributary, by predicting egg movement during a spawning event to see if hatching can occur before eggs settle. A 3-D hydrodynamic model, coupled with a Lagrangian particle tracker, was used to assess hatching rates of three Asian carp species (bighead, grass, and silver carps) in different temperature and flow scenarios in the east Don River, a potential spawning tributary to Lake Ontario. In-river hatching rates were highest in scenarios with warmer summer water temperatures (23-25 degrees C) and flow magnitudes of 15-35 m(3)/s, which occur at least once every year. Using a 3-D hydrodynamic model allowed the inclusion of low-velocity zones where eggs become trapped in lower flow scenarios, thereby reducing modelled hatching success. In-river hatching rates were significantly reduced when the spawning location was moved close to the mouth of the river, with no modelled hatching if spawning occurred in the lower 8 km of the Don River, indicating that preventing Asian carp movement upstream would viably reduce the chances of successfully spawning occurring in this tributary. The magnitude of reduction in spawning success caused by limiting Asian carp passage upstream can guide preventative strategies and the method of using a 3-D hydrodynamic model as a predictive tool could be applied in similar tributaries across the Great Lakes basin.

Their continued range expansion, and potential for subsequent invasion of the Great Lakes, has led to increased concern for the susceptibility of as-yet uncom-promised lotic and lentic systems in the central United States. Because invasive carp eggs and larvae must drift in the river current for the first several days following spawning, numerical drift modeling has emerged as a useful technique for determining whether certain river systems and reaches have the potential to support suspension-to-hatching survival of invasive carp eggs, a critical first step in recruitment. Here we use one such numerical modeling approach, the Fluvial Egg Drift Simulator (FluEgg), to estimate bighead carp (Hypophthal-michthys nobilis) egg hatching success and larval retention in a 47.8-kilometer (km) reach of the multi-thread St. Croix River, Minnesota and Wisconsin, United States. We explore three approaches for obtaining the hydraulic data required by FluEgg, parameterizing the model with either (a) field hydraulic data collected within the main channel during a high-flow event, or hydraulic data output from a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model with both (b) steady, and (c) unsteady flows. We find that the three approaches, along with the range of water temperatures and discharge used in simulations, produce vastly different predictions of streamwise transport and in-river egg hatching probability (0% for field data, 0 to 96% for steady-state hydraulic modeling, and 1.8 to 65% for unsteady modeling). However, all FluEgg simulations, regardless of the source of hydraulic data, predicted that no larvae reach the gas bladder inflation stage within the study reach where nursery habitat is abundant. Overall, these results indicate that the lower St. Croix River is suitable for invasive carp spawning and egg suspension until hatching for a range of discharge and water temperatures. These results highlight the role of complex channel hydraulics and morphology, particularly multi-thread reaches, and their inclusion in ecohydraulic-suitability modeling to determine susceptibility of river systems for invasive carp reproduction.

Rapid assessments may be possible through the application of a combination of bioenergetic and population dynamic models. Paddlefish (Polyodon spathula) is a native species in the central USA with a history of population decline due to waterway development and overharvesting for roe. It is not known whether paddlefish are impacted by resource competition from invasive bigheaded carp populations, including silver (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis), which have expanded dramatically in the Mississippi River. We used bioenergetic models to project the potential impact of invasive silver and bighead carp on zooplankton density and paddlefish somatic growth in backwater habitat. Bioenergetic outputs were translated to impacts on fecundity, becoming inputs for 50-year metapopulation simulations of backwater habitat connected to the main-stem Mississippi River by episodic flood events. Competition with carp reduced growth and increased the risk of population decline for paddlefish. Impacts increased disproportionately with increased carp abundance and were further exacerbated in scenarios with increased diet overlap or decreased zooplankton abundance. We also analysed paddlefish condition data collected at sites near the lower Mississippi River with varying histories of carp invasion. These data give credence to the bioenergetic model output; paddlefish had reduced body condition at sites with long-established, high-density carp populations. We conclude that invasive bigheaded carps have great potential to reduce paddlefish growth, fecundity, and abundance. The pairing of bioenergetics and population models is likely to be broadly useful in assessing the risks posed by other invasive species.",yes

We examined the tensions and conflicts facing invasive Asian carp management in Minnesota by conducting 16 in-depth interviews with state and federal agency officials, academics, and stakeholders. Interviewees discussed the tensions and conflicts they saw impacting management, their implications, and what could be done to address them. We found three key areas of conflict and tension in Asian carp management: 1) scientific uncertainty concerning the impacts of Asian carp and the efficacy and non-target effects of possible management actions; 2) social uncertainty concerning both the lack of societal agreement on how to respond to Asian carp and the need to avoid acting from apathy and/or fear; and 3) the desired approach to research and management – whether it is informed by “political need” or “biological reality”. Our study of these tensions and conflicts reveals their importance to Asian carp management and to invasive species management, more broadly. We conclude with a discussion of possible ways to address these areas of tension and conflict, including the potential of deliberative, participatory approaches to risk-related decision making and the need to productively engage with apathy and fear.",yes

Since the introduction of invasive carps, such as Silver, Bighead, Common and Grass tarp, managers and researcher have been struggling to remove these species while also hypothesizing the detriment of further invasion. This study developed a food web model of four locations on the Mississippi River and used those models to assess the impacts of two scenarios: carp removal and carp invasion. In the Middle Mississippi River where these invasive carps are already present, the models found that it would take a sustained exploitation of up to 30% of initial biomass over an extended period to remove Grass Carp and up to 90% removal of initial biomass to remove Silver and Bighead Carp. In the locations where Silver, Bighead, and Grass Carp are not yet established (i.e., Pools 4,8, and 13) the invasion of these species could cause declines from 10 to 30% in initial biomass of native fishes as well as already established nonnative invasive species.

In the present study, 16S sequencing was carried out to compare microbial communities found in the gills and guts in two filter-feeding fish (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and to determine the influence of sediment and water on fish microbiota in an unfed aquaculture system. Results revealed significant variations in the water, sediment, gill, and gut microbial communities of the two filter-feeding fish in terms of composition, core taxa, diversity, and predictive function. Microbial diversity was significantly higher in the habitat samples (water and sediment) than in the fish host samples (gill and gut) and was significantly higher in the gills than in the gut. Both body niche (i.e., gill vs gut) and host species significantly impacted the fish-associated microbiota, but permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and cluster analysis of core taxa indicated that the effect of body niche outweighed that of the host species in influencing the microbial community. Host microbial communities were more similar to the water microbiota than the sediment microbiota. Source tracking analysis further confirmed that water had a greater contribution than sediment to the fish microbiota, consistent with their upper water-layer habitats. The gill and gut possessed unique core microbiota and predictive functions in comparison to the surrounding environment.

Despite observed F-1 hybrid superiority in experimental settings, effects of postzygotic selection on bighead and silver carp hybrids have not been tested in a natural system. Individual parent and hybrid genotypes were resolved at 57 species-specific loci and used to evaluate postzygotic selection for body condition (W-r) and female reproductive potential (presence of spawning stage gonads and gonadosomatic index [GSI]) in the MRB during 2009-2011. Body condition in the Marseilles Reach, Illinois River declined with a decrease in species-specific allele frequency from 1.0 to 0.4 for each species and early generation hybrids (F-1, F-2, and first-generation backcross) had lower mean W-r than late generation hybrids (2nd+ generation backcrosses) and parentals. Proportions of stage IV and stage V (spawning stage) female gonads differed between bighead and silver carp, but not among parentals and their early and late generation hybrids within the MRB. Mean GSI values did not differ between parentals and hybrids. Because reproductive potential did not differ between hybrids and parentals, our results suggest that early generation hybrids occur in low frequency either as a factor of poor condition (W-r) and postreproductive survival, infrequent reproductive encounters by parental bighead and silver carp, or selection pressures acting on juvenile or immature life stages. Our results suggest that a combination of genetic and environmental factors may contribute to the postzygotic success of bighead and silver carp hybrids in the Mississippi River Basin.",yes

We also tested for inhibition by high concentrations of exogenous DNA, hypothesizing that DNA from increasingly closely related species would be increasingly inhibitory. All tested inhibitors impacted qPCR, though only at very high concentrations - likely a function, in part, of having used an inhibitor-resistant qPCR solution. Closer phylogenetic relatedness resulted in inhibition at lower exogenous DNA concentrations, but not at relatively close phylogenetic scales. Inhibition was also influenced by the qPCR reporter dye used. Importantly, different qPCR assays responded differently to the same inhibitor concentrations. Implications of these results are that the inclusion of more than one assay for the same target taxa in an eDNA survey may be an important countermeasure against false negatives and that internal positive controls may not, in the absence of efforts to maximize inhibition compatibility, provide useful information about the inhibition of an eDNA assay.",yes

However, in order for eDNA monitoring to mature as a research and management tool, there are several critical knowledge gaps that must be filled. One such gap is the fate of eDNA materials in the aquatic environment. Understanding the environmental factors that influence the decay of eDNA and how these factors impact detection probabilities over time and space could have significant implications for eDNA survey design and data interpretation. Here we experimentally explore decay of eDNA associated with bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) biological waste collected from an aquaculture filtration system and with sperm collected from captive silver carp (H. molitrix), and how decay may be influenced by differing levels of water turbulence, temperature, microbial load, and pH. We found that the decay patterns of eDNA associated with both H. nobilis biological waste and H. molitrix milt significantly fit monophasic exponential decay curves. Secondly, we observed that the highest temperature we tested resulted in a decay half-life as much as 5.5x more rapid than the lowest temperature we tested. When we suppressed microbial loads in eDNA samples, we observed that overall losses of eDNA were reduced by about 2.5x. When we amended eDNA samples with pond water the half-life of eDNA was reduced by about 2.25x, despite relatively little apparent increase in the overall microbial load. This pattern indicated that species constituency of the microbial community, in addition to microbial load, might play a critical role in eDNA degradation. A shift in pH from 6.5 to 8.0 in the samples resulted in a 1.6x reduction in eDNA half-life. Water turbulence in our study had no apparent effect on eDNA decay. When we combined different temperature, pH, and microbial load treatments to create a rapid decay condition and a slow decay condition, and tracked eDNA decay over 91 days, we observed a 5.0x greater loss of eDNA by Day 5 under rapid decay conditions than under slow decay conditions. At the end of the trials, the differences in eDNA loss between the rapid decay and baseline and slow decay conditions were 0.1x and 3.3x, respectively.

Some AIS have the potential to depress sportfish populations, reducing recreational fishing opportunities and damaging local economies. Alternatives that could reduce the threat of AIS could be costly. Assessments of how AIS could affect recreational fishing participation and the economic value derived from it would contribute to the evaluation of these alternatives. We assessed best-case and worst-case scenarios for how a range of AIS could affect recreational fishing participation and economic value. We utilized previously developed scenarios for how AIS could affect sportfish populations as input for a recreational fishing model developed by Ready et al. (2018). Their model estimated changes in fishing participation and economic value from such scenarios. Given uncertainty in how AIS could affect sportfish, projected effects of AIS on economic value varied widely, with some scenarios likely to have minimal effects and others leading to losses of over $100 million annually. None of the scenarios would lead to a large percentage decrease in recreational fishing in the eight Great Lake states, largely because anglers have numerous inland fishing opportunities. Nevertheless, lakeshore communities dependent on Great Lakes fishing could still suffer considerable economic loss.

Commercial barge traffic, or tows, moving downstream through the EDBS can facilitate the upstream passage of small fish through the barrier by reducing the voltage gradient of the barrier and causing localized upstream return currents. This study tested whether it is possible to prevent upstream passage of small fish across the barrier by preventing upstream return currents. Measurements of water velocity, voltage gradient, and tow speed, as well as sonar-based observations of resident fish, were made as a tow transited the EDBS moving downstream. The results indicate that upstream return currents can be prevented for typical flow conditions in the CSSC (ambient velocity = 0.15 to 0.23 m/s) when tow speeds are <0.46 m/s. Similarly, increasing the ambient velocity above typical values can prevent upstream return currents for faster tow speeds and larger tows. Additionally, preventing upstream return currents at the EDBS may reduce, but does not prevent, tow-mediated upstream fish passages because tows also cause a temporary reduction in the streamwise voltage gradient at the EDBS.

Whether these carp act as a phosphorus (P) source or sink for phytoplankton is debated. We compared the trophic structures in twenty-three reservoirs with different nutrient concentrations in the flood season (after bigheaded carp introduction) with the dry season (after bigheaded carp harvesting). Fish biomass was positively related to TP, and the slope of the relationship showed no difference between seasons. Bigheaded carp harvesting exceeded the amount introduced, which may explain an observed lower intercept of the relationship and fish biomass to the TP ratio in the dry season. Fish predation pressure on zooplankton (fish: zooplankton biomass ratio as a proxy) was highest in the flood season and increased with TP in both seasons. Accordingly, zooplankton grazing effect on phytoplankton (zooplankton: phytoplankton biomass ratio as a proxy) decreased with fish biomass. Furthermore, both the zooplankton biomass and the zooplankton: phytoplankton biomass ratio were among the lowest reported in the literature for the nutrient range studied. Fish grazing effect on phytoplankton (fish: phytoplankton biomass ratio as a proxy) was also highest in the flood season and decreased with TP in both seasons. Nanoplankton was the dominant phytoplankton group in oligotrophic to mesotrophic reservoirs, while filamentous cyanobacteria dominated in eutrophic reservoirs. Chlorophyll a increased with TP and fish biomass, whereas the yield of chlorophyll a per TP (Chla: TP ratio) increased with fish biomass. Accordingly, both chlorophyll a and the Chla: TP ratio were highest in the flood season. We conclude that bigheaded carp act as P sink at the ecosystem level but as P source for phytoplankton, and enhance the yield of chlorophyll a per TP and thus eutrophication. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Asian carp harvest also provides an opportunity to assess if control efforts can benefit native fishes. To answer this question, 26 years of standardized electrofishing data were analyzed, focusing on gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) body condition (W-r) and abundance (catch-per-unit-effort, CPUE) from the Illinois River (Illinois, USA).

Significant genetic differences are found among populations of native rivers (Yangtze, Pearl, and Amur) as well as introduced/invasive environments (Mississippi R., USA and Danube R., Hungary), suggesting genetic backgrounds and ecological selection may play a role in population differentiation. Population divergence of bighead carp or silver carp has occurred within their native rivers, whereas, within the Mississippi River Basin (MRB)-an introduced region, such genetic differentiation is likely taking place at least in silver carp. Interspecific hybridization between silver and bighead carps is rare within their native regions; however, extensive hybridization is observed in the MRB, which could be contributed by a shift to a more homogenous environment that lacks reproductive isolation barriers for the restriction of gene flow between species. The wild populations of native bighead and silver carps have experienced dramatic declines; in contrast, the introduced bigheaded carps overpopulate the MRB and are considered two invasive species, which strongly suggests fishing capacity (overfishing and underfishing) be a decisive factor for fishery resource exploitation and management.

Using acoustic telemetry of (N = ~104 per year) tagged fish, 13 upstream passages of bigheaded carps occurred through SRLD between 2013 and 2016. Eleven passages occurred through the dam gates and 2 through the lock chamber, indicating deterrents (e.g., CO2) placed in SRLD lock chamber may only limit passage of a small proportion of all fish passing through the lock-and-dam structure. Passages were documented only in 2013 and 2015. Most of the dam gate passages occurred during high water when gates were completely out of the water. Timing of bigheaded carps approaching SRLD was positively correlated with rising water temperature and high tailwater elevation, and all fish approached during late March through mid-September.

Bigheaded carp size and species composition were independent of habitat type. Depth associations were similar for both species, with average occurrence at 2.5-3.5m in the main channel and 1-2m in backwaters.

Material and methods. During 2011-2017, an epizootiological survey on experimental fishery farms of different patterns of ownership was conducted. The objects of research were the clinically healthy and diseased freshwater fish of different age groups, as well as parasites and bacteria of different etiological groups that affect aquatic organisms. A review of the clinical and parasitological study of different age groups and hybrids of silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Valenciennes, 1844) and bighead carp, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis (Richardson, 1845), common carp, Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758, and some cultured rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum, 1792), and brown trout, Salmo trutta Linnaeus, 1758 were conducted. Research methods common for ichthyopathology, microbiology, and fisheries were used. 
Results. The study on fish diseases was conducted both in aquaculture and natural waters, in particular in the reservoirs of the Dnieper Cascade. Not only the growth and development of fish but also the signs and the course of various diseases appeared to depend on water temperature. The resistance of the fish and other hydrobionts to the influence of threshold temperatures depends on their adaptation to particular factors. In the years with a relatively warm vegetation period, the infection rates significantly increased to 25% and above. A significant broadening of the spectrum of parasitic infections over the last decade has been noted. An ecological misbalance in the ecosystems, an increase in the level of organic pollution of water, and, as a result, in the number of pathogenic microorganisms that may be harmful to fish and human health were registered. 
Conclusion. Taking into account the results of the analytical studies regarding climate change in Ukraine, we can predict outbreaks of bacterial and parasitic diseases in fish in the years to come, which may cause significant economic damage to aquaculture farms.",yes

We investigated the presence of young-of-the-year bighead carp in an irrigation canal network of Northern Italy and the environmental conditions associated with spawning in 2011-2015. The adult bighead carp population of the canal network was composed by large, likely mature, individuals with an average density of 45.2 kg/ha (over 10 fold more than in the main river). The 29 juvenile bighead carp found were 7.4-13.1 cm long (TL) and weighed 9.5-12.7 g. Using otolith-derived spawning dates we estimated that these juveniles were 94-100 days old, placing their fertilization and hatch dates in mid-to-end-June. Using this information in combination with thermal and hydraulic data, we examined the validity of existing models predicting the onset of spawning conditions and the viability of egg pathways to elucidate spawning location of the species. While evidence of reproduction was not found every year, we determined that potentially viable spawning conditions (annual degree-days and temperature thresholds) and pathways of egg drift suitable for hatching are present in short, slow-flowing canals.",yes

These data come from survey or monitoring efforts that use a wide variety of tools. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a surveillance tool that uses genetic markers for detecting species and holds potential as a tool for large-scale monitoring programs. Two challenges of eDNA-based studies are uncertainties created by imperfect capture of eDNA in collection samples (e.g., water field samples) and imperfect detection of eDNA using molecular methods (e.g., quantitative PCR). Occurrence models can be used to address these challenges, thus we use an occurrence model to address two objectives: first, to determine how many samples were required to detect species using eDNA; second, to examine when and where to take samples. We collected water samples from three different habitat types in the Upper Mississippi River when both Bighead Carp and Silver Carp were known to be present based on telemetry detections. Each habitat type (backwater, tributary, and impoundment) was sampled during April, May, and November. Detections of eDNA for both species varied across sites and months, but were generally low, 0-19.3% of samples were positive for eDNA. Overall, we found that eDNA-based sampling holds promise to be a powerful monitoring tool for resource managers; however, limitations of eDNA-based sampling include different biological and ecological characteristics of target species such as seasonal habitat usage patterns as well as aspects of different physical environments that impact the implementation of these methods such as water temperature.",yes

The presence of these alien species and their hybrids in Hungarian natural water bodies may pose significant ecological risks (connected with their phytoplankton and zooplankton consumption). To be able to deal with the ecological risks and to understand the potential of invasiveness of these species, one must have information on the population-level genetic structures of these alien fish stocks. Ten microsatellite DNA markers and one mitochondrial marker were used to address these questions. The results showed that the two stocks are genetically different; the lake population was genetically more diverse and consisted of hybrid and silver carp individuals, while the river population contained only silver carps. The mitochondrial sequences found in the two populations originated from the Yangtze River. Based on the different genetic structures of the stocks, one can assume that bigheaded carps do not reproduce in Lake Balaton, while the Tisza River stock represents significant reproductive potential and may become invasive in this river. Bigheaded carps (bighead carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, and silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and their hybrids play an important ecological and economic role in their original habitat, while their introduced stocks may pose serious ecological risks. To address questions about the persistence and invasiveness of these fish, we need to better understand their population structures. The genetic structures of bigheaded carp populations inhabiting Lake Balaton and the Tisza River were examined with ten microsatellite markers and a mitochondrial DNA marker (COI). The Lake Balaton stock showed higher genetic diversity compared with the Tisza River stock. Based on hierarchical clustering, the Tisza population was characterized only by only silver carps, while the Balaton stock included hybrid and silver carp individuals. All COI haplotypes originated from the Yangtze River. Based on the high genomic and mitochondrial diversity, along with the significant deviation from H-W equilibrium and the lack of evidence of bottleneck effect, it can be assumed that bigheaded carps do not reproduce in Lake Balaton. The present stock in Balaton may have originated from repeated introductions and escapes from the surrounding fishponds. The Tisza stock consists solely of silver carp individuals. This stock appears to have significant reproductive potential and may become invasive if environmental factors change due to climate change.",yes

After escaping captivity, both species spread into the Mississippi River Basin and now threaten to enter the Great Lakes. Human consumption is one solution, but many Americans believe that carp is unsavory. A random sample of 2,000 licensed anglers in Missouri was asked to complete a mail-back questionnaire about Asian carp, yielding a 27% response rate (n = 465). Results indicated that knowledge and perception about carp were poor, and food neophobia (fear of new foods) scores were above average. Less than 15% of respondents had eaten carp, but nearly 53% were willing to try. Marketing should focus on the benefits of consumption while downplaying any possible concerns.

Underwater speakers were placed on each side of the barrier opening, and an outboard motor noise (broadband sound; 0.06-10kHz) was broadcast to repel carp that approached within 1m of the channel. Broadband sound was effective at reducing the number of successful crossings in schools of silver carp, bighead carp and a combined school. Repulsion rates were 82.5% (silver carp), 93.7% (bighead carp) and 90.5% (combined).

Recently, pilot stocking with predatory fish, particularly pike, Esox lucius L., has also been conducted. Hence, an examination of the long-term response patterns of phytoplankton to multiple fish-induced stressors was undertaken. In recent years, Chara domination (2000-2004) has helped to stabilize a clear-water state, high/good ecological status, and meso-eutrophic conditions. After the disappearance of Charales in 2004, the rapid, unstable changes in phytoplankton biomass, structure, and biodiversity suggested a shift toward a turbid-water state. As a result, the phytoplankton assemblages changed from those dominated by cryptophytes Y+X2+X1+LO (2000-2004) through those dominated by cyanobacteria K (2005-2008), dinoflagellates LO+Y (2009-2011), and cryptophytes Y+LO+F+X2 (2012), to those dominated by diatoms D+K+P+A (2013-2014) with representative taxa that occur in nutrient-rich and/or nutrient-poor water bodies. The 1967-2014 changes indicated that four periods, two with clear-water state and two with turbid-water state, alternately, one after the other, resulted from different fish pressure. Higher autochthonous fish biomass was usually accompanied by lower phytoplankton biomass. In contrast, the introduction of Cyprinidae fish had a stimulating effect on summer phytoplankton dominated by cyanobateria. Among the nutrients, only phosphorus played an important role.",yes

Because competitive and facilitative mechanisms operate simultaneously, but through different food web pathways, the balance of their combined effects can produce complex and variable responses. 
We used a response-surface experimental design to assess the roles of negative (e.g. intra-, interspecific competition) and positive (e.g. facilitation) interactions between native and invasive juvenile fishes. We tested whether these interactions alter the densities of planktonic and benthic invertebrates to evaluate the magnitude and mechanism(s) influencing the acceptance or resistance of biological invaders. Interactions between bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) or common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were evaluated in mesocosms. 
Intraspecific interactions were 1.5-2.4 times stronger than interspecific interactions between carp species. The only instance of interspecific competition resulted in bighead carp reducing the daily growth of bluegill, whereas the reciprocal interaction resulted in facilitation. Facilitation occurred when bluegill increased the daily growth of low density bighead carp treatments, despite increased numbers of fishes. Bighead carp also increased densities of benthic Chironomidae larvae, which were subsequently consumed by bluegill, but did not result in enhanced bluegill growth. These suites of interactions were not observed between common and bighead carp. 
Our response-surface design proved useful for comparing the relative magnitude of intra-vs. interspecific competition, identifying facilitation among species, and tracing attendant effects on invertebrate communities. By accounting for the directionality of interactions within our experimental framework and tracking responses of prey at lower trophic levels, we provide a clearer understanding of how competitive effects and stressed consumers alter prey communities and influence facilitation.",yes

Due to the extensive ecological impacts associated with these species, prevention of their further range expansion is the aim for fisheries management. Recent behavioral studies indicate bigheaded carps are deterred by acoustic barriers and exhibit negative phonotaxis in response to anthropogenic sound sources (>= 150 dB re 1 mu Pa). However, the impact of long-term exposure to these sounds on the hearing capabilities of bigheaded carps has not been well documented. In this study, the auditory evoked potential (AEP) technique was used to determine auditory thresholds among bigheaded carps before and after exposure to high intensity (155.7 +/- 4.7 dB re 1 mu Pa SPLrms; - 8.0 +/- 4.7 dB re 1 ms(-2) PAL(rms); mean +/- SD) broadband sound. Fish were exposed to sound for 30 min or 24 h and AEP measurements were taken at three time points: immediately after exposure, 48 h, or 96 h later. Results indicate that silver and bighead carp experience temporary threshold shifts (TTSs) in frequency detection following sound exposure with the magnitude and length of TTS correlated with exposure duration.

During the initial years of the invasion, concurrent declines in the body condition and the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of planktivorous Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum and Bigmouth Buffalo Ictiobus cyprinellus were attributed to competition with Asian carp. Using an additional seven years of data (2007-2013), we assessed whether Silver Carp have continued to exert adverse pressure on the condition, CPUE, and biomass of native planktivores or whether there is evidence of a potential rebound in the populations of native planktivores. The extended data set reaffirms the body condition and the CPUE of Bigmouth Buffalo remain significantly reduced. However, unlike previous analyses, we also observed significant reductions in the CPUE of Gizzard Shad. Additionally, new results show that the CPUE and biomass of Bigmouth Buffalo were more inversely related to Silver Carp CPUE and biomass relative to the CPUE and biomass of Gizzard Shad. These results reinforce that Silver Carp likely suppress native planktivores and also suggest that diet and other life-history traits may explain some of the subtle differences in species-specific responses.

One method is the development and use of biocides. Identifying new chemicals as part of the biocide registration approval process can require screening millions of compounds. Traditionally, screening new chemicals has been done in vivo using test. organisms. Using in vitro (e.g., cell lines) and in silico (e.g., computer models) methods decrease test organism requirements and increase screening speed and efficiency. These methods, however, would be greatly improved by better understanding how individual fish species metabolize selected compounds. We combined cell assays and metabolomics to create a powerful tool to facilitate the identification of new control chemicals. Specifically, we exposed cell lines established from bighead carp and silver carp larvae to thiram (7 concentrations) then completed metabolite profiling to assess the dose-response of the bighead carp and silver carp metabolome to thiram. Forty one of the 700 metabolomic markers identified in bighead carp exhibited a dose-response to thiram exposure compared to silver carp in which 205 of 1590 metabolomic markers exhibited a dose-response. Additionally, we identified 11 statistically significant metabolomic markers based upon volcano plot analysis common between both species. This smaller subset of metabolites formed a thiram-specific metabolomic fingerprint which allowed for the creation of a toxicant specific, rather than a species-specific, metabolomic fingerprint. Metabolomic fingerprints may be used in biocide development and improve our understanding of ecologically significant events, such as mass fish kills. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",yes

We reviewed published analyses of long-term fish diversity publications from three intensively managed large river ecosystems to demonstrate the conservation potential of large river ecosystems. We show how the incorporation of recent advances in river concepts will allow a better understanding of river ecosystem functioning and conservation. Lastly, we focus on the Wabash River ecosystem based on high conservation value and provide a list of actions to maintain and support the ecosystem. In the Wabash River, there were originally 66 species of freshwater mussels, but now only 30 species with reproducing populations remain. Although there were multiple stressors over the last century, the largest change in Wabash River fish biodiversity was associated with rapid increases in municipal nutrient loading and invasive bigheaded carps. Like similarly neglected large river systems worldwide, the Wabash River has a surprising amount of ecological resilience and recovery. For instance, of the 151 native fish species found in the 1800s, only three species have experienced local extinctions, making the modern assemblage more intact than many comparable rivers in the Mississippi River basin. However, not all the changes are positive or support the idea of recovery. Primary production underpins the productivity of these ecosystems, and the Wabash River phytoplankton assemblages shifted from high-quality green algae in the 1970s to lower less nutritional blue-green algae as nutrient and invasive species have recently increased. Our recommendations for the Wabash River and other altered rivers include the restoration of natural hydrology for the mainstem and tributaries, nutrient reductions, mechanisms to restore historical hydrologic patterns, additional sediment controls, and improved local hydraulics.",yes

In this study, a recreational behavior model is developed for sport anglers in an eight-state region. It models how angler behavior would change in response to potential changes in fishing quality resulting from ANS transfer. The model also calculates the potential loss in net economic value that anglers enjoy from the fishery. The model is estimated based on data on trips taken by anglers (travel cost data) and on angler statements about how they would respond to changes in fishing quality (contingent behavior data). The model shows that the benefit to recreational anglers from re-establishing hydrologic separation exceeds the costs only if the anticipated impacts of ANS transfer on sport fish catch rates are large and widespread.",yes

We simulated BHC population growth and food web effects under different scenarios of BHC production rates, prey vulnerability to BHCs, and availability of age-0 BHCs to predation by salmonines. In the main basins of Lakes Michigan and Huron, the projected BHC population growth was low or negative, with a projected final BHC biomass of 0.5-1.1 times the initial introductory biomass (2% of total fish biomass for each BHC species), and BHCs had negligible effects on most food web groups across all scenarios. In contrast, in Saginaw Bay and Lake Erie, the projected BHC biomass was 2.5-12.5 times higher than the initial biomass across all scenarios, and the largest increases occurred under scenarios of high prey vulnerability to BHCs and high BHC production rates. High projected BHC biomass in Saginaw Bay and Lake Erie had negative effects on zooplankton and planktivorous fish groups and mixed effects on piscivores but had relatively negligible effects on most other food web groups across all scenarios.

These studies are implemented by collecting water samples from the water body, processing those samples to isolate genetic material contained in the water sample, and using a laboratory assay to find a species-specific genetic marker within a sample of the genetic material. To date, conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been one of the most widely used assays in field studies to detect eDNA. This assay is strictly a test for the presence of the genetic marker. It provides no estimate of the concentration of the target genetic marker in the sample or in the environment. Understanding the concentration of a target marker in the environment is a critical first step toward using the results of eDNA field surveys to support inferences about the location and strength of eDNA sources. In this study, the results of eDNA field surveys are combined with a model of the sensitivity of the field survey methods to estimate target marker concentrations using Bayesian updating. The method is demonstrated for Asian carp in the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) using the results of field surveys for eDNA carried out during the period 2009 through 2012, a four-year period during which more than 5,800 two-liter water samples were collected and analyzed using PCR.

Analysis of the peculiarities of the distribution of allele frequencies and the genotypic composition of Pralb, EST, MDH, ME, and CA loci was carried out in the age-2 and age-3 groups of silver and bighead carps. The prevalence of the frequency of the fast migrating allelic variant F was revealed in comparison with the slow migrating gene at EST locus in the age-3 group of silver carp (Est F = 0.620). The prevalence of the frequency of the fast allelic variant Pralb A in comparison with the slow Pralb B was observed in the silver carp groups (Pralb A = 0.812 in the age-2 and Pralb A = 0.726 in the age-3 groups.

The highest level of average heterozygosity (79.4%) was found in the age-2 group of silver carp, which prevailed over the expected average heterozygosity with a value of 49.4%. In comparison with other studied groups, the age-2 group of bighead carp had the lowest level of average heterozygosity of 59.1% versus the theoretically calculated level of 45.5%. The age-2 and age-3 groups of bighead carp had the highest level of heterozygosity at Ca locus at the level of 82.8 and 78.6% respectively, in contrast to the expected heterozygosity at this locus at the level of 49.9 and 49.7%. A dendrogram of the genetic relationships of different age groups of silver carp was constructed based on the values of genetic distances.

The analysis of the genetic structure of different age groups of the silver and bighead carps was performed by the polymorphism of protein and enzyme systems such as Pralb, EST, MDH, ME, CA loci. The study describes the features of the distribution of allelic frequencies and genotypic variants of the aforementioned loci. The level of average heterozygosity, observed and expected heterozygosity at loci in age-2 and age-3 groups of silver and bighead carps were determined. The high genetic variability of an age-2 group of silver carp at the level of 79.4% indicates the need to stabilize their genetic structure. As a result of the cluster analysis, it was determined that the formation of the genetic structure of the silver carp groups of the ""Sunpoint Ukraine"" farm in the Kharkiv region occurs by species affiliation. The study and use of biochemical markers wi l allow differentiating stocks of silver and bighead carps. As well as in complex analysis with other molecular genetic markers will allow them to develop a genetic passport.""",yes

Predicting population collapse and understanding the self-reinforced feedback mechanisms that erode the resilience of native species are two major challenges in invasion ecology. However, to date, empirical evidence of species invasion-induced regime shifts remains scarce, and the minimum required data to generate early warning signals (EWSs) before critical transitions remains unclear, despite its importance for ecosystem management. By combining 80-year (i.e., 1936–2016) fishery data from Lake Qiandao and a theoretical competition model, we provide evidence that relative to nutrient enrichment and climate change, stocking alien fish species of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Aristichthys nobtilis) is the most important driver leading to the collapse of local fish populations. Detectable EWSs indicated by the variance, autocorrelation and composite resilience indicators require at least ten years of data before an abrupt decline, demonstrating that a long-term ecological monitoring program is necessary for providing insight into resilience dynamics. A structural equation model (SEM) suggests that the combined effects of eutrophication, high water levels and carp stocking-induced water clarity decline may play an important role in the reduced fitness of local fish populations, which subsequently increase the carrying capacity of alien fish populations. Our results demonstrate that stocking alien carps result in competitive exclusion of local fish populations, especially in the current context of water eutrophication and global climate changes. Furthermore, quantifying the minimum required time series length with detectable EWS across various ecosystems should be further studied given that this information is critical for flexible management policies to take actions to avert the harmful transitions.",yes

We explored the effects of bigheaded carp presence on zooplankton communities using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and assessed taxa-specific relationships with bigheaded carp relative abundance using ordinary least-squares regression with an indicator variable for bigheaded carp presence. Zooplankton communities in the UMR were dominated by rotifers and crustacean zooplankton densities were low, making up only 2% of the community density. Zooplankton communities differed where bigheaded carp were present. Density and biomass of cladocerans and copepods were both reduced where bigheaded carp were present but copepods increased with bigheaded carp relative abundance. Ostracod biomass increased in the presence of bigheaded carp whereas rotifers declined with bigheaded carp relative abundance.

The objective of this study was to quantify CO2 concentrations needed to achieve avoidance (voluntary response) and narcosis (involuntary response observed by loss of equilibrium) behaviors in silver carp (H. molitrix) and bighead carp (H. nobilis) at 5, 15, and 25 degrees C. Overall, silver carp and bighead carp displayed avoidance and narcosis behaviors to CO2 at each water temperature, however bighead carp responded at higher CO2 concentrations than silver carp. Behavioral avoidance and narcosis were observed at approximately 40% lower CO2 concentrations in 5 degrees C water relative to 25 degrees C suggesting considerable influence of water temperature on a CO2 stimulus for both species.

Although habitat fragmentation may be detrimental to native fish species, it might act as an effective and economical barrier for controlling the spread of invasive species in riverine systems. Various technologies have been proposed as potential fish deterrents at locks and dams to reduce bigheaded carp (i.e., silver carp and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys spp.)) range expansion in the Upper Mississippi River (UMR). Lock and Dam (LD) 15 is infrequently at open-river condition (spillway gates completely open; hydraulic head across the dam <0.4 m) and has been identified as a potential location for fish deterrent implementation. We used acoustic telemetry to evaluate paddlefish passage at UMR dams and to evaluate seasonal and diel movement of paddlefish and bigheaded carp relative to environmental conditions and lock operations at LD 15. We observed successful paddlefish passage at all dams, with the highest number of passages occurring at LDs 17 and 16. Paddlefish residency events in the downstream lock approach of LD 15 occurred more frequently and for longer durations than residency events of bigheaded carp. We documented upstream passages completed by two individual paddlefish through the lock chamber at LD 15, and a single bighead carp completed upstream passage through the lock chamber during two separate years of this study. We identified four bigheaded carp and 19 paddlefish that made upstream passages through the spillway gates at LD 15 during this study. The majority of the upstream passages through the spillway gates for both species occurred during open river conditions. When hydraulic head was approximately 1-m or greater, we observed these taxa opt for upstream passage through the lock chamber more often than the dam gates. In years with infrequent open-river condition, a deterrent placed in the downstream lock approach may assist in meeting the management goal of reducing upstream passage of bigheaded carps but could also potentially affect paddlefish residency and passage. Continued study to understand the effects of deterrents on native fish could be beneficial for implementing an integrated bigheaded carp control strategy.

Main stem navigation dams on the upper Mississippi River, long considered a deterrent to fish migration, may slow or prevent the spread of invasive fish species. As discharge increases, hydraulic head (i.e., difference between upstream elevation and downstream elevation) at these navigation dams decreases, which is believed to allow for easier fish passage. We used acoustic telemetry to investigate the occurrence, frequency, and timing of bigheaded carp passage of upper Mississippi River dams, along with factors related to successful dam passage. During 2013 through 2017, adult silver carp (H. molitrix), bighead carp (H. nobilis) and their hybrids (N = 358) were tracked throughout the upper Mississippi River. A total of 1078 dam passages by bigheaded carps (N = 158) were observed past 15 dams. Seventy-eight percent of dam passages occurred during April through July. Cox proportional hazards regression models indicated that both upstream and downstream dam passages by these species were strongly affected by hydraulic head height at the dam and water temperature, with dam passages increasing as hydraulic head decreased and water temperature increased. A few dams rarely experience low hydraulic head and passages of those dams by bigheaded carps were rare.

For an acoustic deterrent to be effective however, the hearing ability of bigheaded carp must be characterized. A previous study showed that bigheaded carp detected sound up to 3 kHz but this range is narrower than what has been reported for other ostariophysans. Therefore, silver and bighead carp frequency detection was evaluated in response to 100 Hz to 9 kHz using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). AEPs were recorded from 100 Hz to 5 kHz.

One possible deterrent strategy that was evaluated within the water control structure in 2017 was the use of a 100 hp boat motor acoustic stimulus. Two underwater speakers were installed in each of two culverts to discourage fish movement though the water control structure. Fish passage was monitored using a series of passive integrated transponder (PIT) antennas in a confined study area. A combination of 176 fish consisting of seven different species (native and nonnative) were implanted with PIT tags and relocated downstream of the water control structure. Over 2 days of periodic playback of the acoustic stimulus, 29% of tagged silver carp that were detected crossed though the active underwater speaker array. The acoustic treatment did not significantly reduce silver carp or native centrarchid passage through the culverts. However, numerous silver carp were observed jumping out of the acoustically active culvert at the onset of the stimulus. The acoustic stimulus, especially the frequencies to which silver carp are most sensitive to (< 2000 Hz), rapidly attenuated in the water control structure (water depth 0.55-0.38 m).

Paddlefish had a trophic niche which relied on some resources different from those used by other species, and therefore had the lowest trophic overlap with bigheaded carp and other two native fish. The trophic overlap by bigheaded carp onto native fish was typically stronger than the reverse effects from native fish. Average niche overlap between silver carp and native species was as high as 71%, greater than niche overlap between bighead carp and native fish (64%).

We sequenced the genomes of bighead and silver carps (similar to 1.08G bp and similar to 1.15G bp, respectively) and their hybrids collected from the MRB. We found moderate-to-high heterozygosity in bighead (0.0021) and silver (0.0036) carps, detected significantly higher dN/dS ratios of single-copy orthologous genes in bigheaded carps versus 10 other species of fish, and identified genes in both species potentially associated with environmental adaptation and other invasion-related traits. Additionally, we observed a high genomic similarity (96.3% in all syntenic blocks) between bighead and silver carps and over 90% embryonic viability in their experimentally induced hybrids. Our results suggest intrinsic genomic features of bigheaded carps, likely associated with life history traits that presumably evolved within their native ranges, might have facilitated their initial establishment of invasion, whereas ex-situ interspecific hybridization between the carps might have promoted their range expansion.

To evaluate the control effects of filter-feeding fish (silver carp and bighead carp) on cyanobacterial blooms, the changes in algal species composition along the fish intestine were analyzed by microscopic examination, chlorophyll fluorescence, high-throughput DNA sequencing and pigment ratios. The microscopic examination results showed that both silver carp and bighead carp have a certain control effect on bloom-forming cyanobacteria in spring. The digestion of silver carp in summer could still effectively remove cyanobacteria and reduce the dominance of Microcystis in the phytoplankton community, while the digestion of bighead carp seemed to have little effect on cyanobacteria. The results of the chlorophyll fluorescence method were similar to those of the microscopic analysis, which indicated that silver carp could reduce the cyanobacterial biomass in spring, while bighead carp could significantly promote the dominance of cyanobacteria (p < 0.001). High-throughput DNA sequencing showed that there were significant differences in filter-feeding plankton between silver carp and bighead carp. The midgut may be the main gathering site of intestinal microorganisms, and cyanobacterial digestion mainly occurs in the intestinal segments between the foregut and midgut. The analysis of pigment ratios indicated that selective digestion of phytoplankton by silver carp significantly reduced the dominance of Cyanophyta in its hindgut (p < 0.01), while bighead carp had the opposite effect (p < 0.05), especially in seasons other than spring.

Our objective was to investigate how relative adult biomass and river temperature and discharge affect maximum annual Bigheaded Carp larval production in the UMR using a Ricker stock-recruitment model. Adult Bigheaded Carp relative biomass (kg/h) was estimated annually with boat electrofishing and larvae were collected every 10 d between May and August 2014-2017 in Pools 14-20 in the UMR.

There was a decrease in species richness, diversity, density and biomass, suggesting simplification of the community structure. Species diversity, density, and biomass declined significantly through the growth season, illustrating the great pressure imposed on the zooplankton.

At a fish stocking density of 23.5-38.8 g/m(3), the highest efficiency in controlling cyanobacteria and promoting water condition was achieved, and the impact on zooplankton diversity was weak. Our results indicated that bighead carp can be included in the EAR of lakes and reservoirs, but the optimal density of bighead carp stocking should be carefully considered.",yes

Tong",2020,Cardiac transcriptomics reveals that mapk pathway plays an important role in hypoxia tolerance in bighead carp (<em>Hypophthalmichthys nobilis</em>),Animals,10,9,14,"Simple Summary Acute hypoxia treatment was performed in juvenile bighead carp (Hypophthalmicthys nobilis) by decreasing water O-2. The results showed that blood lactate and serum glucose increased significantly under hypoxia stress, and some differentially expressed genes were identified among hypoxia tolerant, hypoxia sensitive, and normoxia control groups. Differentially expressed genes between hypoxia tolerant and hypoxia sensitive groups were mainly involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, insulin signaling, apoptosis, tight junction, and adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes pathways, of which MAPK signaling pathway played a key role in cardiac tolerance to hypoxia in bighead carp. These results provide a basis for understanding the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxia response in fish and a guide for future genetic breeding programs for hypoxia resistance in bighead carp. As aquatic animals, fishes often encounter various situations of low oxygen, and they have evolved the ability to respond to hypoxia stress. Studies of physiological and molecular responses to hypoxia stress are essential to clarify genetic mechanisms underlying hypoxia tolerance in fish. In this study, we performed acute hypoxia treatment in juvenile bighead carp (Hypophthalmicthys nobilis) by decreasing water O(2)from 6.5 mg/L to 0.5 mg/L in three hours. This hypoxia stress resulted in a significant increase in blood lactate and serum glucose. Comparisons of heart transcriptome among hypoxia tolerant (HT), hypoxia sensitive (HS), and normoxia control (NC) groups showed that 820, 273, and 301 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in HS vs. HT, NC vs. HS, and NC vs. HT (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.01, Fold Change> 2), respectively. KEGG pathway enrichment showed that DEGs between HS and HT groups were mainly involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, insulin signaling, apoptosis, tight junction and adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes pathways, and DEGs in MAPK signaling pathway played a key role in cardiac tolerance to hypoxia. Combined with the results of our previous cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) analysis of hypoxia stress in this species, such genes asstbp2,ttn,mapk,kcnh, andtnfrsfwere identified in both studies, representing the significance of these DEGs in hypoxia tolerance in bighead carp. These results provide insights into the understanding of genetic modulations for fish heart coping with hypoxia stress and generate basic resources for future breeding studies of hypoxia resistance in bighead carp.",yes

Biological invasions have been shown to be linked to the genetic properties of alien host species. It is thus plausible that the holobiont, the host, and its associated microbiome act as an entity to drive invasion success. The bighead carp and silver carp (bigheaded carps), invasive species that exhibit extensive hybridization in the Mississippi River Basin (MRB), provided a unique model to test the holobiont hypothesis of invasion. Here, we investigated the microbiomes of foreguts and hindguts in bigheaded carps and their reciprocal hybrids reared in aquaculture ponds using 16S amplicons and the associated gene prediction. We found an admixed pattern in the gut microbiome community in bigheaded carp hybrids. The hybrid gut microbiomes showed special characteristics such as relatively high alpha diversity in the foregut, an increasing dissimilarity between foreguts and hindguts, and a remarkable proportion of genes coding for putative enzymes related to their digestion of main food resources (Cyanobacteria, cellulose, and chitin). The pond-reared hybrids had advantageous features in genes coding for putative enzymes related to their diet. The above results collectively suggested that the gut microbiomes of hybrids could be beneficial to their local adaptation (e.g., food resource utilization), which might have facilitated their invasion in the MRB. The gut microbial findings, along with the intrinsic genomic features likely associated with life-history traits revealed in our recent study, provide preliminary evidence supporting the holobiont hypothesis of invasion.",yes

Although these structures already impede fish passage, this role could be greatly enhanced by modifying how their spillway gates operate, adding deterrent systems to their locks, and removing carp. This study examined this possibility using numeric modeling and empirical data, which evaluated all three options on an annual basis in both single LDs and pairs under different river flow conditions. Over 100 scenarios were modeled. While all three approaches showed promise, ranging from 8% to 73% reductions in how many carp pass a single LD, when employed together at pairs of LDs, upstream movement rates of invasive carp could be reduced 98–99% from current levels. Although modifying spillway gate operation is the least expensive option, its efficacy drops at high flows, so lock deterrents and/or removal using fishing/trapping are required to move towards complete blockage. Improved deterrent efficacy could also offset the need for more efficient removal. This model could help prioritize research and management actions for containing carp.",yes

Swimming performance, the relationship between swim speed and time-to-fatigue, has been used to design fishways and identify barriers to fish movement. However, existing numerical models do not all capture the variability in swimming abilities nor the turbulent, unsteady, and three-dimensional aspect of natural flows. This deficiency is particularly problematic for fish species whose behavior is poorly understood (i.e., invasive fish) and at sites with complex flow patterns. Here, we combine species-specific swimming performance with high resolution abstractions of fluid flow in a new agent-based framework to model fatigue of upstream swimming fish under turbulent flow conditions. Our model simulates fish paths, in the absence of information on their behavioral tendencies, based on a rules-set aimed at fish swimming as far upstream as possible before complete exhaustion by selecting the path of least fatigue. We demonstrate how this model functions by examining theoretical passage of invasive silver carp, Hypopthalmichthys molitrix, and bighead carp, H. nobilis, as well a native fish, the lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, through a typical Mississippi River lock-and-dam (Lock-and-Dam #8 near Genoa, WI). The model then tests whether passage could be reduced by altering spillway gate operations. Model results suggest that passage of all three species is low under current gate operations and that passage of both carp species could be further reduced by about half through minor changes in spillway gate operation without apparent impacts on navigation, scour, or lake sturgeon passage. Model results are qualitatively consistent with observed passage rates monitored by other studies at similar lock-and-dams and are consistent with the possibility that the model likely overestimates passage rates by relying on physiological data only. This approach could be exported to other applications and fish species to help manage and control fish migration and dispersal, especially for fish whose behavior and ecology are poorly understood and not presently quantifiable.",yes

Considering protein profiles mucus samples from C. catla contained the highest molecular weight proteins while C. carpio has one unique protein band of 14.13 kDa the weight of which resembles the weight of lysozyme, a protective element of mucus. Lectin activity was highest in C. idella indicative of low resistance while it was the lowest in H. molitrix. Alkaline phosphatase level was the highest in C. catla, and was the lowest in C. carpio. Overall results indicted C. carpio as the most resistant species as it showed better values for the immune components. Higher values of protein contents and alkaline phosphatase for C. catla may be in favor of its higher susceptibility.

In order to examine the effects of UIP on the characteristics of silver carp surimi, it was added into surimi paste in four levels (0.25-1.0 g/100 g) while protein/water contents were kept constant. The UIP addition reduced the pH of surimi gel from 6.6 to 6.4. Emulsifying stability of surimi pastes were notably improved by UIP addition while emulsification capacity showed no changes. The addition of UIP up to 0.25 g/100 g maintained the textural characteristics and water holding capacity of surimi gels. The gel whiteness was not adversely changed by UIP addition up to 0.75 g/100 g. The SEM images revealed the presence of compact microstructures with dense surfaces due to UIP addition.

Previous studies suggest that suitable BHC habitat is limited to a few productive, nearshore areas. However, those studies did not consider the influence of BHC's diet plasticity or the presence of spatially-discrete subsurface prey resources. This study aimed to characterise Lake Michigan's suitability for BHC and evaluate the importance of these considerations in habitat suitability assessments. We used simulated outputs of prey biomass (phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detritus) and water temperature from a three-dimensional biophysical model of Lake Michigan to evaluate growth rate potential (GRP, quantitative index of habitat suitability) of adult BHC throughout the entire volume of the lake. Our GRP model applied a foraging model and a bioenergetics model to translate prey concentrations and water temperatures into habitat quality indexed by individual fish growth rate. We defined suitable habitat as habitats that can support GRP >= 0 g g(-1) day(-1). We developed six feeding scenarios to evaluate the impact of diet flexibility and subsurface prey resources on suitable habitat quantity. Scenarios were defined by the number of prey types the fish could consume and the depths at which they could feed (surface or whole water column). Consistent with previous studies, we found that habitats with the highest quality were concentrated near river mouths and in eutrophic areas of Green Bay. However, in contrast to previous studies, we found suitable offshore habitat for bighead carp owing to our added considerations of diet plasticity and subsurface prey resources. For silver carp, these considerations extended suitable habitat within Green Bay and in some tributary-influenced nearshore areas, but offshore areas remained predominantly unsuitable in all feeding scenarios. Differences in simulated habitat suitability between these two species probably reflect differences in energy density and mass of the specific fishes we used in our model. However, reports of these two species in environments where they coexist indicate that bighead carp grow at faster rates than silver carp, as our model simulated. Our vertical analysis at Muskegon, MI, U.S.A. indicates that subsurface temperature and prey biomass are not only sufficient to support bighead carp growth but provide maximum habitat quality during late summer stratification. Overall, our study demonstrates that BHC are capable of surviving and growing in much larger areas of Lake Michigan than predicted by previous studies, and thus suggests that the risk of establishment is not sufficiently reduced by low plankton concentrations. Maps generated by our model identified the potential for cross-lake migration corridors that may facilitate and accelerate lake-wide movements. We believe these maps could be used to prioritise surveillance protocols by identifying areas to which BHC might spread upon entering the lake. More broadly, this research demonstrates how the physiology and trophic ecology of BHC contributes to their high invasive capacity and can permit their survival in novel environments.",no

BigheadHypophthalmichthys nobilisand Silver CarpH. molitrix, collectively 'bigheaded carps' (BHC), are planktivorous fishes threatening to invade Lake Michigan. While previous studies indicate the lake contains habitat suitable for BHC growth, there is a need to understand how anthropogenic-driven changes to the abiotic and biotic environment could alter its vulnerability to BHC. We applied a spatially explicit model of BHC growth rate potential (GRP; g g(-1)d(-1)) to nine biophysical model scenarios to evaluate changes in habitat suitability in Lake Michigan. Scenarios differed in meteorology (cool, reference, warm), annual tributary phosphorus loads (0, 3300, and 5600 MTA), and the presence/absence of invasive dreissenid mussels. Mussel effects on BHC GRP relied on their contact with the surface mixed layer (SML), the depth of which was affected by meteorology. The warm year advanced the expansion of Bighead Carp habitat by increasing temperature-dependent foraging rates and lessening the time of competitive interaction with mussels due to earlier stratification separating mussels from the SML. Phosphorus loads were the most influential driver of the lake's suitability. Compared to present conditions, we estimate BHC could have grown an additional 8-40% annually in the 1980s when mussels were not in the lake and phosphorus loads were higher. Our study demonstrates how climate change and nutrient enrichment can increase Lake Michigan's vulnerability to BHC by affecting thermal regime and productivity, thereby limiting negative effects of dreissenid mussels on BHC growth.",no

Resilience, the ability of an ecosystem to recover after perturbation, was observed at local scales and within some taxa but has yet to manifest at a river-wide scale and often co-varied with abiotic environmental or seasonal factors.

Comparative studies assessing a wide number of digestive enzymes on fishes that compete for food resources are lacking, especially in the context of an introduced species. It is generally thought that the invasive silver carp (SVC; Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) directly compete for food resources with the native gizzard shad (GZS; Dorosoma cepedianum) in waters where they coexist. We compared 19 digestive enzymes between SVC and GZS throughout a year and in two rivers in the Midwestern United States: Illinois River and Wabash River. All digestive enzymes analyzed were detected in both SVC and GZS in both rivers. However, the profiles of the digestive enzymes varied by species. Alkaline phosphatase, valine arylamidase, acid phosphatase, naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase and N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase were all much higher in SVC than in GZS. Differences between digestive enzyme profiles were also observed between rivers and months. This study demonstrates the utility of using an ecological approach to compare physiological features in fishes.",no

Bigheaded Carp recruited in large numbers in the LaGrange Reach of the Illinois River during the summer of 2014. This provided an opportunity to determine whether native piscivorous fish prey upon invasive carp when they are abundant. Using electrofishing and fyke nets in the LaGrange Reach (August 1-November 8, 2014), we sampled native predatory fish (n = 1,472) for stomach content analysis. Fish community data from the Upper Mississippi River Restoration Program's Long-Term Resource Monitoring was used to quantify prey abundance (fish < 100 mm) in the study area and indicated that bigheaded carp represented 9% of available prey. Stomach content analysis revealed that the frequency of occurrence of juvenile bigheaded carp was greater than 15% in Shortnose Gar Lepisosteus platostomus, White Bass Morone chrysops, Black Crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus, Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus, Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu, Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, White Crappie Pomoxis annularis, Yellow Perch Perca flavescens, Flathead Catfish Pylodictis olivaris, Freshwater Drum Aplodinotus grunniens, and Yellow Bass Morone mississippiensis. Predators sampled in August and September foraged more heavily on juvenile bigheaded carp than those sampled in October and November. Electivity analysis suggested that juvenile bigheaded carp were selected over native forage by White Bass, Black Crappie, and Shortnose Gar, as these predators continued consuming them even as availability declined. Our results imply that native piscivores in the Illinois River consume and sometimes prefer juvenile bigheaded carp as prey. These results suggest that native predators might play a role in regulating bigheaded carp recruitment and that negative impacts to predators in areas of dense carp populations might be somewhat mitigated by the consumption of juvenile bigheaded carp.""",no

Population abundance upstream of Lock and Dam (LD) 19 (LD19) on the upper Mississippi River (UMR) has likely been limited by the high‐head dam at this location, which restricts all upstream fish passage to the lock chamber. We measured otolith (lapillus) stable isotope composition and elemental microchemistry of 146 Silver Carp (n = 77 females, 69 males) and 141 Bighead Carp (n = 76 females, 65 males) to determine early life environments (ELEs) of adult bigheaded carp captured upstream of LD19 at the invasion front, in an area of intense management (Pools 16–19). Otolith oxygen isotope ratios (δ18O) and elemental ratios (Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca) were compared to values of isotope and elemental ratios in water from putative ELEs to assign the ELE for each fish. Most Bighead Carp (68.8%) and Silver Carp (54.1%) collected upstream of LD19 had otolith core signatures consistent with ELEs downstream of LD19. Nineteen percent of Bighead Carp and 34% of Silver Carp could not be classified. The sex ratios of bigheaded carp (Pools 17–19 combined) with otolith core signatures downstream of LD19 did not differ from 1:1. Our results, when compared to those of Whitledge et al.

Changes in species dominance has been documented by a 25-year fish community dataset encompassing six reaches of the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. Specifically, common carp (Cyprinus carpio) abundance has declined across all reaches, whereas silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) have increased in abundance in the southern three reaches. To test whether signals in the data were consistent with regime transitions, changes in body-size patterns and trends in functional biomass and variance of functional biomass of the fish community were assessed. I further explored biomass thresholds relative to transitions. Shifts in body-size aggregations and trends in functional biomass support hypotheses that transitions from common carp dominance to a more functional diverse community represent alternate regimes. Results indicate such transitions occurred in the early 2000s for the two most northern reaches, and that the third most northern reach is nearing this transition. In the southern reaches, results indicate that transitions from common carp dominance to silver and bighead carp dominance also represent alternate regimes. Regime transitions support biomass thresholds between 8000 and 10,000 g per unit of day electrofishing effort of common carp and between 20 and 2000 g per unit effort in silver and bighead carp. Consistencies across reaches with similar dominance patterns provide support that reinforcing feedbacks, unique to the functional attributes of the dominant species, occur at similar biomass levels. Building knowledge of such feedback mechanisms is imperative to effectively manage for desired regimes.",no

Understanding these dynamics is important when assessing the impacts of invasive species, such as bighead carp, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, and silver carp, H. molitrix, (bigheaded carp). These species have established throughout much of the Mississippi River Basin; however, Lock and Dam 19 (LD19) has slowed their establishment in the Upper Mississippi River, resulting in low-density populations with limited reproduction upstream. The age and growth of Bigheaded Carp in recently established populations, especially in this region, are poorly characterized. Therefore, we compared the age and growth of bigheaded carp for four low-density navigation pools of the Mississippi River near the invasion front with one long-established high-density population, separated by LD19. To assess growth rates and age at maturity, we estimated consensus age from pectoral spines, postcleithra, and vertebrae from 1229 bigheaded carp, 30 fish per 50 mm size class. Length at age of capture and back-calculated length-at-age were used to create growth curves using VBGC analysis. The analysis indicated higher growth rates of bighead carp and silver carp upstream of Lock and Dam 19 than downstream. Comparison of growth models with a likelihood ratio test indicated differences in length at time zero between the pools for bighead carp but not for silver carp. However, maximum length and growth rates were significantly different for silver carp upstream and downstream of the dam but not for bighead carp. These results will be used to better understand the population dynamics of this emerging population to inform control and containment actions.",no

During observation period in composition of algocenosis prevailed representatives of following groups of algae: Volvocophyceae, Desmidiales, Bacillariophyta, Xanthophyta, Zygnematophyceae, Chrysophyta, Pyrrophyta, Protococcophyceae, Cyanophyta, Euglenophyta. Concentration of algae in ponds varied from 0.58 up to 6.78 mln/l, total biomass varied from 0.87 to 9.70 mg/l. Zooplankton of the inspected ponds was represented by species of three systematic groups: Rotatoria, Cladocera and Copepoda. Concentration of zooplankton organisms varied from 0.0055 to 3.9432 mln/m3, biomass varied from 0.05 to 18.60 g/m3. Zoobenthos included Oligochaeta, Clitellata and insect larvae (Chironomidae, Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera). Prevalence of various representatives of plankton groups depended on the season of the year. In zoobentos samples there were found oligochaeta, chironomid and mayfly larvae, caddisflies and leeches. Higher plants were represented by 8 hydrophytic species, 1 species with floating leaves and 10 aerial coastal species.

The results showed that apple pectin at 0.025% and konjac glucomannan at a 2% level exhibited improved gel-forming ability significantly (p < 0.05). SDS-PAGE revealed high molecular weight protein crosslinks in apple pectin treated surimi gels and disappearance of myosin bands in konjac glucomannan treated surimi gels. The water holding capacity of surimi was the highest when 0.075 g/100 g of apple pectin was added. Konjac glucomannan treated gels exhibited superior whiteness values. The analysis of soluble protein revealed that hydrophobic bonds increased in both the treatments. The hardness values of pectin gels enhanced as the level increased. Other TPA parameters are shown an inconsistent trend. It can be demonstrated that the incorporation of apple pectin and konjac glucomannan at a level of 0.025 and 2.0% may be a novel strategy to improve the gel strength of the surimi.

The characteristic organs called gill rakers (GRs), found in many such filter feeders, facilitate the efficient filtration of food particles such as phytoplankton that are of a few microns in size. The motivation to investigate the rheology of the GR mucus stems from our desire to understand its role in aiding the filter feeding process in the silver carp. The mucus-rich fluid, in a 'thick and sticky' state may facilitate the adhesion of food particulates. The permeation and transport through the GR membrane are facilitated by the action of external shear forces that induce varying shear strain rates. Therefore, mucus rheology can provide a vital clue to the tremendous outcompeting nature of the silver carp within the pool of filter feeding fish. Based on this it was posited that GR mucus may provide an adhesive function to food particles and act as a transport vehicle to assist in the filter feeding process. The main objective of the protocol is to determine the yield stress of the mucus, attributed to the minimum shear stress required to initiate flow at which irreversible plastic deformation is first observed across a structured viscoelastic material. Accordingly, rheological properties of the GR mucus, i.e., viscosity, storage, and loss moduli, were investigated for its non-Newtonian, shear-thinning nature using a rotational rheometer. A protocol presented here is employed to analyze the rheological properties of mucus extracted from the gill rakers of a silver carp, fished at Hart Creek location of the Missouri River. The protocol aims to develop an effective strategy for rheological testing and material characterization of mucus assumed to be a structured viscoelastic material.",no

We conducted an experiment to assess whether fish herding using percussive sound or electrical stimuli can enhance catch rates and detection of bigheaded carp and other fishes in surface-to-bottom gill nets. Catch rates (fish net set(-1)) from traditional gill net sets where no herding method was applied were compared to sets combined with either sound stimuli (physical impacts to the boat hull and water surface to produce percussive sound) or electricity produced from a pulsed-DC electrofisher to manipulate fish movements. For most species, herding increased catch rates and detection probability compared to control sets. Sound stimuli increased catch rates of Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) by over three times, whereas electrical stimuli increased catch rates by over six times. Catch of Bighead Carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) was highest in nets paired with sound stimuli. Herding methods also reduced the number of samples required to attain target detection probabilities for bigheaded carp. Herding techniques combined with gill netting may be a valuable option for targeted bigheaded carp sampling, especially when electrofishing or netting alone is ineffective for these evasive fishes. Synergistic methods may provide a cost effective means of improving detection probabilities for bigheaded carp at their invasion front or other locations where densities are low and uncertainty of capture is high.",no

Alternatively, naturally free-flowing tributaries could offer alternative habitat for successful reproduction. Our objectives were to examine temporal and spatial variation in adult gonad development, ichthyoplankton densities, and back-calculated spawn dates of invasive carp collected in three UMR tributaries. We compared ichthyoplankton densities between the upstream and mouth reaches of tributaries and densities between the UMR and adjacent tributaries. Ichthyoplankton samples were collected every 10 d, and adult invasive carp were sampled monthly at nine sites throughout the Des Moines, Skunk, Iowa, Cedar, and Mississippi rivers during April-October 2014 and 2015. Peaks in adult gonadosomatic index, an increase in postspawn females, and ichthyoplankton collections suggested that peak spawning occurred during late May through June, when water temperatures were 18-30 degrees C and channel velocities were at least 0.7 m/s. However, reproduction occurred as late as August in some tributaries. Ichthyoplankton densities were highest in the Des Moines River among tributaries, but tributary densities were similar to the UMR densities, suggesting that both tributaries and main-stem sites provide suitable spawning locations. Invasive carp reproduction in UMR tributaries provides additional sources of potential recruitment for further population expansion upstream in the UMR and should be considered when devising plans for controlling populations along the leading edge of the invasion.",no

We measured individual metabolic rate (ṀO2) and calculated the routine metabolic rate (RMR), Q10 and critical oxygen tension (Pcrit) after two weeks of acclimation at either 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 °C. Gill morphology was also examined. A variety of Pcrit responses was observed: the Pcrit increased (qing bo), decreased (Chinese bream and grass carp) or was conserved (big head carp, silver carp and common carp) with increasing acclimation temperatures (10 - 30 °C). Apparent thermal-induced gill remodeling was found in three (grass carp, big head carp and silver carp) of the six cyprinids studied, with common carp also exhibiting some degree of gill structure modification. RMR was positively correlated with Pcrit at temperatures ranging from 10 to 30 °C in qing bo and big head carp; however, such significant correlation was not found in the remaining cyprinids, possibly due to their gill remodeling potential during thermal changes and thus an increased lamellar surface area at higher temperatures.",no

However, only a little information regarding the effectiveness of the enhancement program has been reported. In this context, this study investigates on an enhancement program through monitoring the efficacy based on parentage analysis. Methods A total of 1,529 hatchery-reared fish and 869 larvae were sampled from the middle Yangtze River in 2016 and 2017 and were genotyped by thirteen microsatellite loci. Based on the results of parentage analysis the larvae were divided into three populations: (1) larvae population with both parents being hatchery-reared fish (=R), (2) larvae population with only a male or a female parent being hatchery-reared fish (=H), and (3) larvae population with no hatchery-reared fish parent (=W). The following analyses were also carried out: (1) assessing the contribution of hatchery-reared offspring to larval resources, and (2) evaluating the genetic effect of stock enhancement on the wild population. Results In total, 10.37% and 11.56% of larvae were identified as the offspring produced by hatchery-reared fish released in 2016 and 2017, respectively. In 2017, some of the larvae were assigned unambiguously to hatchery-reared fish released in 2016. In terms of the number of offspring produced, the hatchery-reared fish have shown significant variations. No significant differences were found among all the larvae populations concerning genetic parameters for diversity. High levels of genetic diversity of all larvae populations were obtained. Low FSTvalues obtained from pairwise FST analysis, as well as the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), revealed high genetic structural similarity among all the larvae populations. The genetic composition of the W larvae population in 2017 was different from that of all other larvae populations (all larvae populations in 2016, and R and H larvae populations in 2017), as demonstrated from the results of STRUCTURE and PCA analyses. Conclusion It was demonstrated that hatchery-reared fish are successful in producing the offspring in the natural environment during multiple years, which might assist in increasing the abundance of larvae. The hatchery-reared fish had variations in terms of the success rates on reproduction. Also, the hatchery-reared enhancement program had no significant effect on the genetic diversity or the genetic structure of wild populations. However, the genetic component of the W larvae population in 2017 was changed as compared to 2016, which was not due to the hatchery-reared enhancement program for silver carp. This could be due to flooding, but the specific causes need further studies. Our results clearly show the necessity to continuously inspect the genetic impact of the enhancement program so that historical information can be utilized for further research.",no

The exact test result of population differentiation based on haplotype frequencies was consistent with no significant change in haplotype frequency after release. Pairwise genetic differentiation index (F-ST) and gene flow (Nm) revealed no genetic differentiation among four populations.

Ultrasound-assisted thawing (UT) can save 13.5%similar to 40.4% time, and high ultrasonic frequency (80 kHz and 100 kHz) did not cause high thawing loss. Thawing at higher ultrasonic frequency could reduce the damage of the secondary and tertiary structure of myofibrillar proteins. No significant differences were observed for the main relaxation component (T-22) and its peak area proportion (P-22), and rheological properties, resulting in similar printing performance. After steam heating, cuboid samples in UT-100 kHz group kept the best geometrical shapes and had the highest hardness, springiness, and chewiness.

Flow velocity has been recognized to affect the spawning of fishes delivering drifting eggs in rivers. However, solid scientific supports and associated mechanisms to establish quantitative relations between flow velocity and fish reproduction, taking into account spawning, fertilizing, hatching, as well as surviving, are lacking. In this paper, we quantified the relationship between flow velocity and reproduction of Chinese carps through both lab and field experiments. The results showed that a minimum velocity was required to trigger Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (H. molitrix) releasing eggs, and a velocity range was preferred to sustain spawning activity. However, the embryo incubation and larvae development of H. molitrix were found to be inhibited with the increase in flow velocity. Considering the requirements of spawning and hatching, as well as larvae surviving, an optimized flow velocity processes was identified for the reproduction of H. molitrix in rivers. These findings were of great significance to the adaptive operation of reservoirs to create reasonable and precise ecological flows for managing fish reproduction, as shown by the promising results in the engineering application to the Three Gorges Reservoir.

In this study, Sirius red was employed to determine the Tds of collagen from calf tendon, silver carp skin, frog and salmon skins (38.2 degrees C, 32.6 degrees C, 33.8 degrees C, and 15.6 degrees C, respectively) to explore a new method that does not require special equipment and only needs 2-3 mg sample for one measurement. This method was suitable for the determination of the denaturation temperature of collagen from terrestrial, aquatic and amphibian animals. Analysis of variance and t-test revealed that no significant difference was found between Sirius Red and viscosity methods. However, the Sirius Red method needs simpler equipment and less sample than viscosity and other methods. So it could be used as a convenient approach to determine the denaturation temperature of collagen instead of the viscosity method.",no

These species evolved in Asia, are now invasive in the Mississippi River, and feed voraciously on microparticles including plankton. The food habits and biology of these carps are broadly similar to many filter-feeding fish, none of whose chemical ecology has been examined. We conducted five experiments. First, we demonstrated that buccal-pharngeal pumping (BPP), a behavior in which fish pump water into their buccal cavities, is responsible for sampling food: BPP activity in both silver and bighead carps was low and increased nearly 25-fold after exposure to a filtrate of a planktonic food mixture (P < 0.01) and over 35-fold when planktonic food was added (P < 0.001). Next, we showed that of nine food filtrates, the one containing chemicals released by spirulina, a type of cyanobacterium, was the most potent planktonic component for both species. The potency of filtrates varied between species in ways that reflected their different chemical compositions. While L-amino acids could explain about half of the activity of food filtrate, other unknown chemical stimuli were also implicated. Finally, occlusion experiments showed the olfactory sense has a very important, but not exclusive, role in bigheaded carp feeding behaviors and this might be exploited in both their control and culture.",no

Despite broad phylogenetic representation, little is known about the origin, development, or evolution of EBOs. We hypothesize that both heterochronic and heterotopic changes throughout the evolution of EBOs are at the root of their morphological diversity. Heterochrony is a foundational explanation in developmental studies, however, heterotopy, a developmental change in spatial or topographical relationships, can have even more profound effects on a given structure but has received relatively little attention. Here, we investigate how developmental mechanisms may drive morphological diversity of EBOs within otomorphan fishes. We compare early pharyngeal development in three species, Anchoa mitchilli (Engraulidae) which has the most basic EBO, B. tyrannus (Clupeidae) which has a more complex EBO, and Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Cyprinidae) which has the most complex EBO yet described. Using branchial arch growth rates and morphological analyses, we illustrate how both heterochronic and heterotopic mechanisms are responsible for some of the phenotypic diversity seen in otomorphan EBOs. Importantly, we also identify conserved developmental patterns that further our understanding of how EBOs may have first originated and evolved across actinopterygian fishes.",no

The findings revealed that MH and MWH aided in the production of gel formations by promoting myosin aggregation. Myosin from silver carps demonstrated enhanced sulfhydryl group and surface hydrophobicity after MWH treatment, as well as a dense network structure. The distribution of micropores becomes more uniform when the microwave time is increased. Actually, the total effect of microwave time on myosin is not substantially different. The correlation between particle size distribution and protein aggregation was also studied, in terms of time savings, the MWH of short microwave action is preferable since it not only promotes myosin aggregation but also avoids the drawbacks of a rapid warming rate.

Additionally, differences in the behaviour of hybrids may lead to deleterious ecosystem effects that compound any negative impacts of the invading parental species. Invasive silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) provide an opportunity to evaluate how hybridisation may influence the behaviour, dispersal, and spread of an invasive species introgressive complex. In order to investigate the role hybrids may have in the invasion ecology of bigheaded carps, we examined the distribution, movements, and environmental cues for movement of two invasive fishes and their hybrids in the Illinois River (U.S.A.). Early generation hybrids (e.g. F-1,F-2, and first-generation backcross individuals) composed a greater proportion of the population at the invasion front where abundances of bigheaded carp were low. A greater proportion of early hybrids passed through dams upstream towards the invasion front than did other hybrids and parental species. The movements and environmental cues for movement of late-generation backcrosses (more genetically similar to parental genotype) were not different from the parental species with which they shared the most alleles. Although the direction of the relationship between movement and environment was sometimes different for the parental species and associated advanced generation hybrids, these results indicate that management for parental species will also affect most hybrids. Although early generation hybrids are rare, our results indicate they may disperse towards low-density population zones (i.e. invasion fronts) or are produced at greater frequency in low-density areas. These rare hybrids have the potential to produce a variety of unique genetic combinations that could result in more rapid adaptation of a non-native population to their invaded range potentially facilitating the establishment of invasive species.",no

Management of invasive bigheaded carps in the Illinois River has focused on using human-made barriers and harvest to limit dispersal towards the Laurentian Great Lakes. Acoustic telemetry data were used to parameterize multistate models to examine the spatial dynamics of bigheaded carps in the Illinois River to (1) evaluate the effects of existing dams on movement, (2) identify how individuals distribute among pools, and (3) gauge the effects of reductions in movement towards the invasion front. Multistate models estimated that movement was generally less likely among upper river pools (Starved Rock, Marseilles, and Dresden Island) than the lower river (La Grange and Peoria) which matched the pattern of gated versus wicket style dams. Simulations using estimated movement probabilities indicated that Bighead Carp accumulate in La Grange Pool while Silver Carp accumulate in Alton Pool. Fewer Bighead Carp reached the upper river compared to Silver Carp during simulations. Reducing upstream movement probabilities (e.g., reduced propagule pressure) by75% into any of the upper river pools could reduce upper river abundance with similar results regardless of location. Given bigheaded carp reproduction in the upper Illinois River is presently limited, reduced movement towards the invasion front coupled with removal of individuals reaching these areas could limit potential future dispersal towards the Great Lakes.",no

Swan Lake, a 1100-ha Illinois River (USA) backwater, was rehabilitated to restore ecosystem functions, but may provide valuable habitat for invasive bigheaded carps [bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (H.molitrix)]. Use (residency and passages) of Swan Lake by invasive bigheaded carps was monitored using acoustic telemetry (n=50 individuals/species) to evaluate the use of a large, restored habitat from 2004 to 2005. Passages (entrances/exits) by bigheaded carps were highest in winter, and residency was highest in the summer. Bighead carp backwater use was associated with the differences in temperature between the main channel and backwater, and passages primarily occurred between 18:00h and midnight. Silver carp backwater use was positively correlated with water level and main channel discharge, and fewer passages occurred between 12:00h and 18:00h than during any other time of day. Harvest occurring during summer or high main channel discharge could reduce backwater abundances while maintenance of low water levels could reduce overall backwater use.

Invasive species can have varying ecosystem effects and responses to control throughout an invaded range, and removal near invasion fronts may inadvertently alter these characteristics. Bigheaded carp (bighead carp (Hypophthabnichthys nobilis Richardson) and silver carp (H. molitrix Valenciennes)) are invasive fishes from Asia invading North American freshwater ecosystems. We used mobile hydroacoustic surveys to examine bigheaded carp population characteristics from 2012 to 2015 across an invasion gradient in the Illinois River (USA), one of the most likely pathways to the Laurentian Great Lakes. These bigheaded carp species comprised 23-46% of fish community abundance and 45-78% of fish biomass across reaches, with lower contribution near the invasion front where intensive management by harvest occurs. Bigheaded carp prevalence in the community did not differ by habitat and comprised > 50% of community abundance and biomass throughout the river for most size classes. We identified negative relationships between density and relative weight (an index of body condition) of bigheaded carp, suggesting evidence of potential density-dependent intraspecific competition. Efforts to reduce invasive species abundances near invasion fronts may reduce prevalence. However, this could inadvertently release individuals from density-dependent competition and could enhance reproductive potential, growth or movements. By employing a suite of control efforts, including continuous removal efforts (including novel approaches) and by limiting movements (e.g., utilizing roads, fences, dams), it may be possible to offset undesired consequences of increased condition.",no

Recruitment is oftentimes determined by conditions experienced during early life, and winter conditions become increasingly influential as species invade north in temperate regions. Bighead Carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and Silver Carp (H. molitrix) have invaded mid-latitudes of North America and threaten to invade farther north. We conducted pond experiments and bioenergetic simulations to: (1) assess the effects of mild winters on juvenile Bighead Carp and Silver Carp at mid-latitudes; (2) determine how conspecific density affects juveniles during mild winters; and, (3) determine effects of increased winter severity at increasing latitudes. Both species displayed high overwinter survival (85%) in pond experiments. Bighead Carp grew in length (mean 2mm) and maintained initial body mass and percent dry mass (index of energy content). Silver Carp maintained initial length and mass and remained in high condition (dry mass). Conspecific densities tested did not affect growth, condition, or survival. Simulations suggest juvenile Bighead Carp could energetically survive the longest, coldest winter simulated (48 degrees latitude); however, energy reserves at the start of winter became increasingly important for survival as latitude increased. Bighead Carp and Silver Carp recruitment success at mid-latitudes is likely driven by non-winter factors. If these species invade farther north, winter severity may play a stronger role in offspring survival, recruitment, and population dynamics. However, warmer and shorter winters at high latitudes caused by climate change will minimize this potential bottleneck and increase chances of successful recruitment.",no

The experimental low-temperature heat capacity was measured in the temperature range of 1.85 to 302.8 K using a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) and the higher temperature C-p from 223.15 K to 382.15 K by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) method. For an interpretation of the experimental, low-temperature data, the vibrational heat capacity of the pure silver carp collagen was calculated based on the contribution of a sum of the vibrational heat capacity of 4248 amino acids. The vibrational heat capacity for each amino acids was taken from Advanced Thermal Analysis System (ATHAS) Data Bank for individual poly (amino acid) residues based on their group and skeletal vibrational spectra. Comparing of the experimental heat capacity of the collagen with additive components and the calculated vibrational heat capacity of the pure silver carp collagen shows that the differences range from around 10% at 100 K to 14% at 300 K temperature. Such thermal analysis can provide information about the contribution to C-p of unknown components or impurities in the investigated system. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",no

Using Sound Metrics software, multiple measurements of each fish (L-T, side aspect angle and distance from the camera) at different times were analysed by two experienced operators while a subset of data was analysed by two inexperienced operators. The main result showed high variability in intra-fish L-T measurements. The number of measurements required to minimise errors and to obtain robust fish measurements (true L-T +/- 3 cm) was estimated by a bootstrap method. Three to five measurements per fish were recommended for fish surveys in rivers. In this experimental study, aiming to reproduce river conditions, no evidence of fish position (side aspect angle and distance from the camera) effect was detected, but an operator effect (partially explained by training) was observed. General linear mixed models also showed that lengths of the smallest fish (L-T < 57 cm) were overestimated and lengths of the largest fish (L-T > 57 cm) were underestimated in comparison with their true lengths.

These gears offer an alternative to sampling in habitats or conditions that are unsuitable for traditional sampling gears, and they may be capable of sampling a different subset of the population. However, little is known about their efficacy as catfish sampling gear. We developed a standardized method for deploying setlines in the form of bank poles and assessed the catch rate, species composition, and efficacy of bank poles in the Kansas River, Kansas. We also used Lindgren-Pitman hook timers to investigate temporal patterns of capture, retention rates, and optimal soak duration. Bank poles (n = 897) were equipped with 6/0 circle hooks baited with Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix cut bait and were deployed overnight during the summers of 2018 and 2019. Bank poles captured a total of seven fish species, with 97% of the species composition being catfishes (n = 258; mean TL = 688 +/- 182.7 mm; range = 392-1,310 mm). Blue Catfish Ictalurus furcatus (45%) was the most commonly captured species, followed by Channel Catfish I. punctatus (37%) and Flathead Catfish Pylodictis olivaris (15%). The success rate for hooking and landing fish with bank poles was 29%. There was no difference between total catch rates from standard bank poles and those from bank poles equipped with hook timers. Higher catch rates were observed early in the set time for Channel and Flathead catfish, whereas a relatively steady catch rate was observed for Blue Catfish. Overall, 46% of catfish were caught within 3 h of gear deployment and 72% were caught within 5 h. We recommend adopting shortened soak durations (about 5 h) to prevent bait loss and to optimize fish retention.

Monthly fish price data were collected from the Bangladesh Department of Agricultural Marketing website from January 2007 to December 2019, a period characterized by rapid emergence of aquaculture and declining capture fisheries. Our analysis shows that for almost all the fish species, the direction of market information is moving from the retail market to the wholesale market. This implies that retail markets are more organized and wholesalers follow the price set by the retailers. In the short run, only rohu market shows bidirectional information flow between wholesale and retail markets indicating no single market has significant control over the price.

The total water-spread area of the selected beels varied widely (8-50 ha), with 68.75% of the beels showing a reduction in water-spread area over the past 30 years. High levels of siltation and encroachment and detachment of marginal areas through the construction of roads were the major factors responsible for the reduction in the water-spread area of the beels. The reduction was observed to be in the range of over 33% in three beels (Raghunath Sora, Chulkani, and Dudua beel) to 83% in Bhoishpuri beel. In addition, one beel (Chulkani) experienced reduction in its deep pool area, which is an important wetland area that provides shelter to brood fishes during the dry season. Only 12.5% of the beels studied practiced enclosure (pen) culture for rearing fish. None practiced cage culture. Our study showed that only two beels (Bhoishpuri and Tariachora) were free from exotic fishes; the remaining surveyed beels reported exotic species such as, Cyprinus carpio (Common Carp), Ctenopharyngodon idella (Grass Carp), Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Silver Carp), H. nobilis (Bighead Carp) and Piaractus brachypomus (Pacu). The prevalence of exotic fishes in the majority of the beels (due both to escape from nearby aquaculture ponds during floods and intentional stocking in certain beels) would have adversely affected the diversity of indigenous fishes in those wetlands. From discussion with the fishers, 50% of the beels surveyed experienced a reduction in the number of fish species from that recorded 10-20 years ago. In addition to climate change-related factors (e.g. abnormal rains, floods, or drought-like situations), other factors - both natural (e.g. hyper-nutrification) and anthropogenic (e.g. construction of roads, houses, and other structures) - also adversely affected the studied wetlands. To help cope with these factors and increase the adaptive capacity of fishers, four measures aimed at mitigation are suggested. These are: the practice of enclosure aquaculture in beels; the construction of floating macrophyte refuges (katal); deep pool refuges; and stock enhancement programmes with climate-resilient indigenous fishes.",no

A proper SP amount could significantly(p < 0.05) improve the breaking force, deformation, hardness, springiness and whiteness of surimi gels, 6% PHCSP addition showing the best performance in improving the surimi gel strength. Stress relaxation results indicated that SP addition could increase equilibrium stress, the equilibrium elastic coefficient (E1) and decay elastic coefficient (E2), indicating an increased hardness and elasticity. Rheological tests revealed significantly higher G ' values for surimi/SP composite gels than pure surimi gel, indicating the high elasticity of composite gels. The relaxation time T2 indicated that free water was converted into immobile water or even bound water when SP added into surimi. Additionally, surimi/6% PHCSP gels were found to retain more water due to chitosan precipitated along with the SP. The lightness and whiteness values of surimi gels were enhanced in surimi gels added with a proper SP amount. However, excessive SP had a dilution effect on fish myofibrillar protein (MP) that dominates gel formation, resulting in weak surimi gels. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that surimi/6% PHCSP gels could form a dense and homogeneous network with a pore density of 24.74 +/- 0.08/mu m2. Overall, SP could endow the sliver carp surimi with a satisfactory gelation ability because SP had the self-gelation ability or had an interaction with MP.",no

These species vary seasonally in distribution and abundance due to environmental conditions such as precipitation and temperature. Monitoring this seasonal movement is important for management to control the population size and spread of the species. We examined if environmental DNA (eDNA) approaches could detect seasonal changes of these species. To do this, we developed a novel genetic marker that was able to both detect and differentiate bighead and silver carp DNA. We used the marker, combined with a novel occupancy model, to study the occurrence of bigheaded carps at 3 sites on the Wabash River over the course of a year. We studied the Wabash River because of concerns that carps may be able to use the system to invade the Great Lakes via a now closed (ca. 2017) connection at Eagle Marsh between the Wabash River's watershed and the Great Lakes' watershed. We found seasonal trends in the probability of detection and occupancy that varied across sites. These findings demonstrate that eDNA methods can detect seasonal changes in bigheaded carps densities and suggest that the amount of eDNA present changes seasonally. The site that was farthest upstream and had the lowest carp densities exhibited the strongest seasonal trends for both detection probabilities and sample occupancy probabilities. Furthermore, other observations suggest that carps seasonally leave this site, and we were able to detect this with our eDNA approach.

As the cultured juveniles are released into self-recruiting wild population to increase fisheries resources yields, they may potentially come along with negative impacts such as intra-inter specific completion, loss of genetic diversity and fitness, even causing genetic risk. To assess the relationship between genetic risk and stock enhancement (SE) of the silver carp in the Yangtze River (YR); microsatellite loci amplification, parentage assignment, genetic diversity, genetic differentiation and structure were conducted and testified by the help of eleven fluorescence labeled microsatellite markers method. Results showed that silver carp populations in the YR had relatively higher genetic diversity (UHe), inbreeding coefficient (Fis), and effective population size (Ne) than breeding stock populations from eight hatcheries. By using the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), results showed that the percentage of variance among populations and within populations were 4.15 % and 95.85 %, respectively, which indicated that genetic structure of YR populations possibly had been changed by SE. Therefore, the present study suggests that the large-scale SE possibly resulted in negative genetic impact on silver carp population.

Because of climate fluctuation, human activities, and water conservancy projects, it has been reported that natural fish resources of the silver carp have been declining in a wavy trend from 1950. However, few studies have explored the potential effects of determining the relationship between the adult fish and fish larvae. Using the field survey method, this study analyzed the fisheries resource status of the adult silver carp and its early life stage in the Yangtze River. Results indicated that different geographic populations showed significant habitat dependence, and the adult silver carp tends to choose habitats with slow water flow, rich biological bait, and less human interference. What is more, its distribution pattern has regional and seasonal differences obviously. Additionally, redundancy analysis on the fish larvae showed that water temperature and water flow are the two most important factors influencing the fish larvae blooming. According to the generalized additive model (GAM), the hydrological factors that significantly influence the larvae abundance are water temperature, transparency, daily increasing rate of water level, and discharge (p < 0.05). Combining the historical and present research data, the results indicated that river and lake connected habitat is essential for the silver carp recruitment and migration. Future studies should focus on the complementary mechanism of silver carp both in the natural habitat and invasion waters. It is suggested that the spawning habitat should be well protected during the channel project and economic belt construction along the Yangtze River.",no

Gel properties and cross-linking of surimi gels increased significantly (P < 0.05) when surimi was induced by MTGase.

Our objectives were to assess: (1) the number of mitochondrial haplotypes that were introduced and how they are distributed in North America, which may provide insight into the history of the invasion, (2) how genetic diversity compares between the native Asian and introduced North American populations, (3) how genetic variation is structured across the North American ranges of SC and BHC as well as between the two species, and (4) whether patterns of genetic diversity and structure are likely to affect success of environmental DNA programs for monitoring these species. In both species, we found relatively few mitochondrial haplotypes, and most were present throughout the range. For both SC and BHC, unique haplotypes were found only in a portion of the species’ range, possibly indicating the location of additional, more recent introductions. In both species, genetic diversity was moderately lower in North American populations (i.e., 75–90% of that found in Asian populations), but genetic diversity still remained high. We found very little population genetic structure, consistent with a rapidly spreading invasive species, and did not find evidence of cryptic interspecific hybrids. The markers developed for eDNA monitoring will be effective for detecting the majority of individuals of these species in North America. The relatively high level of genetic variation and lack of population structure of SC and BHC in North America indicate that genetic diversity likely will not limit their persistence and that high connectivity will likely complicate efforts to control these invasive species.",no

Quality changes of the samples were investigated in terms of total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), peroxide value (PV), thiobarbituric acid (TBA) and microbial counts (total viable counts (TVC) and total psychrotrophic count (TPC)). Results showed that the extract could reduce chemical deterioration and lipid oxidation in the fillets compared to the control, as reflected with lower TVBN and TBA values. Also, pomegranate peel extract reduced TVC and PTC of the fillets about 2 Log10CFU/g compared with control. Furthermore, silver carp fillets treated with the encapsulated pomegranate peel extract showed the lowest amount of lipid oxidation and microbial deterioration during the storage period compared with the control and pure extract treatments.",no

Liu",2021,Effect of high intensity ultrasound on gelation properties of silver carp surimi with different salt contents,Ultrasonics Sonochemistry,70,,,"Surimi from silver carp with different salt contents (0-5%) was obtained treated by high intensity ultrasound (HIU, 100 kHz 91 W.cm(-2)). The gelation properties of samples were evaluated by puncture properties, microstructures, water-holding capacity, dynamic rheological properties and intermolecular interactions. As the salt content increased from 0 to 5%, gel properties of surimi without HIU significantly improved. For samples with low-salt (0-2% NaCl) content, HIU induced obvious enhancement in breaking force and deformation. HIU promoted the protein aggregation linked by SeS bonds, hydrophobic interactions and non-disulfide covalent bonds in surimi gels with low-salt content. Moreover, microstructures of HIU surimi gels with low-salt content were more compact than those of the corresponding control samples. HIU also improved the gelation properties of surimi with 3% NaCl to an extent. However, for high-salt (4-5% NaCl) samples, HIU decreased the breaking force and deformation of surimi gels due to the degradation of proteins suggested by increased TCA-soluble peptides. In conclusion, HIU effectively improved the gelation properties of surimi with low-salt content (0-2% NaCl), but was harmful for high-salt (4-5% NaCl) surimi. This might provide the theoretical basis for the production of low-salt surimi gels.",no

HIUBC facilitated the protein dispersion and more compact microstructures formation, which was beneficial to obtaining the highest water-holding ca-pacity (WHC) of HIUBC gels. Meanwhile, the puncture properties of HIUBC gels were significantly improved via the formation of more epsilon-(gamma-Glu)-Lys and S-S bonds. HIUAC and HIUAS promoted the formation of epsilon-(gamma-Glu)-Lys bonds, but also induced the protein degradation, as evidenced by the decreased solubility and relatively higher TCA-soluble peptides. Thus, no obvious improvement of puncture properties and WHC was observed for HIUAC or HIUAS gels. In conclusion, HIUBC was beneficial to facilitating protein dispersion, thereby improving gelation properties of surimi during heat-induced gelling process. However, HIUAC and HIUAS hardly influenced gelation properties of surimi. This might provide an effective method of HIU pre-treatment for promoting gelation properties of surimi.",no

The eggs, which are believed to perish if they settle before hatching, are slightly denser than water and are held in suspension by water turbulence. It is possible to use egg drift modeling to assess the capability of a river to support the survival of Asian carp eggs. Detection of spawning and estimation of egg abundance in the drift are typically assessed by ichthyoplankton trawls. Correct sampling design and interpretation of trawl data require knowledge of the vertical distribution of eggs in the drift, which can be accomplished with particle transport models. Data that are required to populate models of egg drift and vertical distribution include physical properties of assessed rivers and information on egg size, density, and terminal fall velocity, but data on these egg characteristics have not been previously available. Physical characteristics of the eggs are presented as a function of postfertilization time. We recorded mean egg diameter and terminal fall velocity for eggs from each Asian carp species during the first 5 h of development and at approximately 12 and 22 h postfertilization. Eggs of all species reached their maximum size before 4 h. Water-hardened eggs of Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Grass Carp Ctenopharyngodon idella were similarly sized in our trials, and water-hardened eggs of Bighead Carp H. nobilis were the largest. After water hardening, Silver Carp eggs sank slowest, and Bighead Carp eggs sank fastest. For a given species, smaller-diameter eggs generally had faster terminal fall velocities and higher specific gravity than larger eggs. We provide regression models of egg density and diameter for all three species, discuss usage of these data in modeling the drift and dispersion of Asian carp eggs, and discuss implications for egg sampling design.",no

Questions about recruitment potential motivate a need for accurate models of egg and larval dispersal. Quantitative data on swimming behaviors and capabilities during early ontogeny are needed to improve these dispersal models. We measured ontogenetic changes in routine and maximum swimming speeds of bighead, grass, and silver carp larvae. Daily measurements of routine swimming speed were taken for two weeks post-hatch using a still camera and the LARVEL program, a custom image-analysis software. Larval swimming speed was calculated using larval locations in subsequent image frames and time between images. Using an endurance chamber, we determined the maximum swimming speed of larvae (post-gas bladder inflation) for four to eight weeks post-hatch. For all species, larval swimming speeds showed similar trends with respect to ontogeny: increases in maximum speed, and decreases in routine speed. Maximum speeds of bighead and grass carp larvae were similar and generally faster than silver carp larvae. Routine swimming speeds of all larvae were highest before gas bladder inflation, most likely because gas bladder inflation allowed the fish to maintain position without swimming. Downward vertical velocities of pre-gas bladder inflation fish were faster than upward velocities. Among the three species, grass carp larvae had the highest swimming speeds in the pre-gas bladder inflation period, and the lowest speeds in the post-gas bladder inflation period. Knowledge of swimming capability of these species, along with hydraulic characteristics of a river, enables further refinement of models of embryonic and larval drift.",no

In the Illinois River, an important tributary of the Upper Mississippi River, reproduction appears to be sporadic and frequently unsuccessful, yet bigheaded carp densities in this river are among the highest recorded on the continent. Understanding the causative factors behind erratic recruitment in this commercially-harvested invasive species is important for both limiting their spread and managing their harvest. We analyzed weekly catch records from 15 years of a standardized monitoring program to document the emergence of age-0 bigheaded carp in relation to environmental conditions. The appearance of age-0 fish was generally linked to hydrographic attributes, which probably serve as a cue for spawning. However, we found profound differences in the number of age-0 fish among years, which varied by as much as five orders of magnitude in successive years. The strong link between summer flooding and age-0 fish production we observed emphasizes the importance of understanding the hydrologic context in which sustained invasions occur. Despite evidence of sporadic recruitment, bigheaded carp populations in the Illinois River appear to be consistent or increasing because of particularly strong, episodic year classes.",no

Monitoring their reproduction can help to determine establishment in new areas but is difficult due to challenges associated with identifying fish eggs. Recently, random forest models provided accurate identification of eggs based on morphological traits, but the models have not been validated using independent data. Our objective was to evaluate the predictive performance of egg identification models developed by Camacho et al. (2019) for classifying invasive carp eggs by using an independent data set. When invasive carp were grouped as one category, predictive accuracy was high at the following levels: family (89%), genus (90%), species (91%), and species with reduced predictor variables (94%). Invasive carp predictive accuracy decreased when we only considered observations from newly sampled locations (family: 9%; genus: 22%; species: 30%; species with reduced predictor variables: 70%), suggesting potential differences in egg characteristics among locations. Random forest models using a combination of previous and new data resulted in high predictive accuracy for invasive carp (96-98%) when invasive carp were grouped as one class for all models at the family, genus, and species levels. The two most influential predictor variables were average membrane diameter and average embryo diameter; the probability of predicting an invasive carp egg increased with these metrics. High predictive accuracy metrics suggest that these trained and validated random forest models can be used to identify invasive carp eggs based on morphometric variables. However, decreased performance at new locations suggests that more research would be beneficial to determine the models' applicability to a larger spatial region.",no

It is relevant to check the presence of BMNs in organs of migratory and non-migratory fishes. The presence of BMNs was investigated in the samples of ethmoid bones of atlantic salmon, northern pike and silver carp by the method of magnetic force microscopy. As a result, the biological material of ethmoid bones of migratory and non-migratory fishes contain both separate BMNs and their chains, so BMNs in the ethmoid bone of fishes are not related to their ability to migrate in the geomagnetic field.",no

Bone tissue from phytophagous carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) was used to obtain bioactive peptides through papain-assisted hydrolysis. The peptides with molecular weight lower than 3 kDa were characterized through MALDI-ToF/ToF mass spectrometry and bioinformatics tools. As a prerequisite for microencapsulation, the ability of these peptides to bind the flavonoids extracted from yellow onion skins was further tested through fluorescence quenching measurements. The results obtained demonstrate a considerable binding potency with a binding value of 106 and also the presence of one single or one class of binding site during the interaction process of flavonoids with peptides, in which the main forces involved are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions.

The safety concentrations (SCs) of FAS to Carassius auratus, Ctenopharyngodon idellus and Hypophthalmichthys molitrix were 1.92 x 10(10) cells/L, 1.58 x 10(11) cells/L and 1.30 x 10(11) cells/L, respectively.

Microwave processing technologies such as microwave drying, heating and sterilizing play a significant role in food quality and safety control. However, few reviews have been published in recent years summarizing the latest developments in the application of microwave technology in the food industry. Scope and approach: This review focuses on recent applications of microwave processing technologies including microwave drying, heating, and sterilizing in fruit (banana, apple, olive, sour cherries, pomegranate arils, blueberries, kiwifruit, aronia, strawberry, and grape tomato), vegetables (potato, bamboo shoot, purslane leaves, onion, green bean, pumpkin, eggplant, edamame, sea tangle, garlic, kale, red cabbage, tomato, cassava, lentils, chickpea, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, jalapefio peppers, and coriander foliage), and meat products (sardine fish, restructured silver carp slices, sea cucumber, beef semitendinosus muscle, bovine supraspinatus muscle, camel longissimus dorsi muscle, foal meat, bovine gluteus medium muscle, chicken steak, mature cows semimembranosus and semitendinosus muscles, kavurma (a ready-to-eat meat product), salmon, cod, drumettes, and beef slices), changes in product quality as affected with microwave processing are discussed in details, and future directions of research are presented. Key findings and conclusions: Microwave drying has the advantages of low energy consumption and high efficiency as compared to conventional drying, while producing more porous structure of foods. Microwave drying usually combines with other conventional drying to enhance the quality of a food product. Compared with the traditional method, microwave heating or cooking can generally retain higher levels of bioactive components, antioxidant activity and attractive color of vegetables, while microwave cooking with water can cause a serious drop in nutrients due to leaching and thermal liability. Microwave sterilization has the capacity to completely inactivate microorganisms and effectively destroy enzyme activity, and less effect on antioxidant activity, texture and color of food products compared with conventional pasteurization.

The flow regime alternation of rivers has an impact on the spawning and reproduction conditions of four major Chinese carps in the lower reaches of the Three Gorges Reservoir. To investigate the changes in hydrological conditions and spawning and reproduction performances of four major Chinese carps during their spawning period before and after impoundment of Three Gorges Reservoir, a quantitative analysis of the relevance between such hydrological parameters as flow, water level, sediment concentration and water temperature of Yichang Station and larva runoff of the four species during their spawning period was carried out. As suggested by the results, when four major Chinese carps are spawning, the proper hydrological parameters would be 11,000-15,000 m(3)/s for flow, 43.0-46.0 m for water level, 0.01-0.21 kg/m(3) for sediment concentration and 4-8 d for water rise, and 22-24 degrees C for water temperature. Among those values, water rise and sediment concentration appear to be in significant positive correlation with the larvae abundance of four major Chinese carps, and thus remain critical factors. After the impoundment of Three Gorges Reservoir, the declining trend in flow, water level and water temperature during the spawning period of four major Chinese carps is not significant when compared with that in sediment concentration (by over 98%). The spawning and reproduction time of four species also gets retarded due to the late-coming proper water temperature, so does the spawning scale. The proportions of four carps also change a lot, with silver carp ascending to be at the highest ratio among them. This study can provide a reference for the protection of important fishes in the lower reaches of Three Gorges Reservoir.",no

Lamer",2022,"Trophic reorganization of native planktivorous fishes at different density extremes of bigheaded carps in the Illinois and Mississippi rivers, USA",Biological Invasions,,,,"The widespread introduction of non-native fishes has contributed to freshwater ecosystems being considered among the most altered ecosystems globally. Of particular concern are invasive planktivorous fishes (e.g., silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and bighead carp H. nobilis, collectively known as bigheaded carps) that have the potential to modify basal food web structure and compete for planktonic resources with native planktivores and young-of-year fishes. Bigheaded carps have proliferated throughout the Mississippi River basin, creating an outsized potential for resource competition with native fishes. Studies have showed niche overlap between bigheaded carps and native planktivores is generally high but that overlap varies among rivers. Importantly, niche overlap has not been assessed for density extremes of bigheaded carps within a river to determine whether trophic niches changed as a result of the invasion. The objectives of this study were to determine whether (1) silver and/or bighead carps share a similar isotopic niche with four native planktivores, and (2) that association varies ecologically (i.e., low- and high-densities of bigheaded carps) and spatially (i.e., between rivers). Our results generally show high trophic overlap among species, suggesting potential direct resource competition. Niche overlap was higher in study reaches with low densities of bigheaded carps compared to reaches with high densities, presumably due to intense resource competition and limiting of resources under high densities of bigheaded carps. Across density extremes, trophic reorganization by bigmouth buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus) was divergent from other native planktivores. Species-specific responses may be due to subtle differences in feeding strategies, degree of planktivory, food selectivity, and correlated food size distributions.",no

Although silver carp, Hypophthalmicthys molitrix, is an important aquaculture species in South Asia, information on sperm biology and storage is limited. The study aims to test the efficacy of NaCl solutions for activation and short-term storage of silver carp sperm. We found that the motility of silver carp sperm lasted for 45 sec after activation in distilled water. Sperm motility was higher within the first 10 sec of sperm activation, but sperm movement decreased with increasing activation time. When sperm was suspended a graded dilution of NaCl solutions (17 mM to 188 mM), sperm was immobilized at 154mM NaCl (287 mOsmol kg–1). The efficacy of sperm immobilizing solutions was validated during short-term storage at 4°C. A total of 7.1 ± 3.1% sperm was motile in 154 mM NaCl after 5 days of storage. Sperm motility lasted up to 2 days when sperm diluted in 103, 120, 171 and 188 mM NaCl solutions. The osmotic balance between seminal plasma and NaCl solution prepared at 154 mM prevented sperm activation and provided a suitable media for short-term storage.

"Hassan, N. M.",2018,Isolation and molecular identification of lactobacillus plantarum from intestinal samples of silver carp,Ukrainian Journal of Ecology,8,3,146-148,"The intestines of most animals contain bacterial species called lactobacilli. Lactobacillus plantarum is a microorganism that settles in the intestinal environment and inhibits the activities of useless microorganisms and pathogens (Andanil et al., 2012). Lactic acid bacteria are the most important probiotic microorganisms including various bacteria such as lactobacilli and Bifidobacterium (Marco et al. 2006). Lactobacilli are gram-positive, non-motile, spore-less and catalase negative bacilli that convert different sugars into lactate and acetate (Guy et al., 2014). L. casei and L. plantarum also have good antagonistic impacts on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (Salehi, 2013). Probiotics can stabilize microbial balance in the intestinal environment by improving their health and usefulness. In addition, probiotics play an important role in maintaining the consumers' health through the synthesis of some essential nutrients (Behnsen et al., 2009; Mohammadian et al., 2014). The bacterium was identified by a molecular technique using a primer designed from the 16S rRNA gene to perform PCR reaction for the detection of Lactobacillus genera (Nour, 1998). The intestines from 50 fish specimens were sampled, among which 28 positive samples of L. plantarum were identified and isolated after staining and testing by PCR (Lotfi et al. 2010).",no

Results showed that the gel strength, hardness, springiness and water holding capacity (WHC) of surimi gels at low salt concentration were inferior to those at high salt content, regardless of the treatments. Compared with the traditional water bath heating, ultrasonic-assisted treatments significantly improved the gelation properties of surimi at the same salt level. In fact, ultrasound treatment also facilitated the unfolding of alpha-helix structure of the protein, with the resulting exposure of internal groups further enhancing hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds between protein molecules, thereby leading to the formation of denser microstructures with smaller holes. Furthermore, the most noteworthy ultrasonic treatment group was ultrasoundassisted preheating (U + W) group, whose gelation performance under low salt condition, was comparable with that of the traditional two-stage heating (W + W) group with high salt content. Overall, ultrasound-assisted water bath preheating proved to be a feasible approach to improve the gel properties and microstructures of low-salt surimi gels.",no

Fish were first exposed to 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 mL L-1 2-PE, and the time of induction (deep anesthesia) and recovery were measured. At concentrations of 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 mL L-1 2-PE, all fish were anaesthetized within 3 min of exposure. For assessing possible stress effects caused by effective concentrations of 2-PE, the haematological indices, serum cortisol and glucose were determined in the deeply anaesthetized fish as stress indicators. 2-PE exposure resulted in a significant increase in red blood cell (RBC) amounts at 0.1 and 0.3 mL L-1. A parallel increase in hemoglobin and Haematocrite amounts at 0.1 concentrations (p<0.05) was observed. The serum cortisol levels had the highest amount in 0.1 mL L-1 of 2-PE. Moreover 2-PE exposure resulted in a significant increase in glucose amounts first at the 0.1 and later in the 0.3 mL L-1 concentrations. This study shows that rapid induction of deep anesthesia with a relatively high concentration of 2-PE (0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 mL L-1) was associated with the lowest effects on the haematological and serum biochemical indices in silver carp and so 0.7 mL L-1 could be suggested as a suitable dose for haematological studies in this species.",no

Preliminary assessments of spawning potential of Great Lakes tributaries are needed to effectively allocate resources to early-detection programs and more detailed hydrodynamic modelling. Previous preliminary assessments determining the Asian carp spawning potential of tributaries potentially masked temporal variations in stream temperature and velocity. A preliminary assessment was developed that incorporates both the spawning biology of Asian carps and the hydrodynamics of tributaries, based on data at a higher temporal resolution than used previously, to determine the spawning potential of a tributary. The assessment was conducted on eight Lake Ontario tributaries, based on in-situ temperature and velocity data from 2009 to 2014. Two tributaries were found to be suitable using mean data across the assessed time frame; however, inter-annual suitability varied greatly and six tributaries were found to be suitable in at least one of six years over the study period. The assessment highlights previously unexplored inter-annual variation in suitability and provides a method using existing data to identify suitable tributaries for more detailed analyses involving hydrodynamic modelling. This approach can be used as a heuristic first step to inform management actions, such as early-detection and rapid-response programs, to prevent Asian carp spawning in the Canadian Great Lakes basin.",no

Hydrodynamic modelling can determine if successful hatching of carp eggs can occur in a tributary, by predicting egg movement during a spawning event to see if hatching can occur before eggs settle. A 3-D hydrodynamic model, coupled with a Lagrangian particle tracker, was used to assess hatching rates of three Asian carp species (bighead, grass, and silver carps) in different temperature and flow scenarios in the east Don River, a potential spawning tributary to Lake Ontario. In-river hatching rates were highest in scenarios with warmer summer water temperatures (23-25 degrees C) and flow magnitudes of 15-35 m(3)/s, which occur at least once every year. Using a 3-D hydrodynamic model allowed the inclusion of low-velocity zones where eggs become trapped in lower flow scenarios, thereby reducing modelled hatching success. In-river hatching rates were significantly reduced when the spawning location was moved close to the mouth of the river, with no modelled hatching if spawning occurred in the lower 8 km of the Don River, indicating that preventing Asian carp movement upstream would viably reduce the chances of successfully spawning occurring in this tributary. The magnitude of reduction in spawning success caused by limiting Asian carp passage upstream can guide preventative strategies and the method of using a 3-D hydrodynamic model as a predictive tool could be applied in similar tributaries across the Great Lakes basin.

Our objectives were to quantify patterns and habitat associations of adult bigheaded carp reproduction, larval production, and habitat use; such information is important for control strategies and identifying recruitment sources. During May-August 2011, we sampled adults and larvae at 10 sites distributed adjacent to and within the main channel of the Mississippi River at Pool 26 (study area = 28 river kilometers). Female reproductive status, adult location, and larval density were compared to environmental conditions, including temperature, site velocity, and turbidity. Large females spawned earlier than their smaller counterparts. No clear spawning aggregations of adults were observed, suggesting plasticity in staging habitat. Larvae were distributed across all sites during flooding. Larval density was positively related to velocity and turbidity, suggesting that nondepositional areas may facilitate recruitment. Bigheaded carp larvae comprised 10% of the ichthyofauna. Although pooled reaches are a source of recruitment for bigheaded carp in the Mississippi River system, the low densities of bigheaded carp larvae relative to native larvae cannot explain the dominance of adults in this system. Our findings provide insights into the plastic nature of bigheaded carp reproduction and habitats associated with larval development. Control efforts that target large adult females should be conducted earlier during the spring spawn. To maintain fishing pressure, such control efforts would likely need to continue through the summer, when smaller individuals spawn, discharge decreases, and CPUE increases. However, we found no specific mass staging area or habitat type where adult females could be targeted.""",no

In the present work, we describe the construction of recombinant (r) common carp (Cyprinus carpio; c) FSH (rcFSH) and LH (rcLH) using the Pichia pastoris system, the generation of specific antibodies against their respective beta subunits, and their use in the development and validation of specific ELISAs. We produced carp rLH and rFSH as single-chain polypeptides, wherein the GTH subunit alpha was joined with either cLH beta or cFSH beta mature protein-coding sequences to form a fusion gene that encodes a yoked polypeptide, in which the GTH beta-subunit forms the N-terminal part and the alpha-subunit forms the C-terminal part. Competitive ELISAs were developed, using primary antibodies against rcLH beta or rcFSH beta respectively, and rcLH beta alpha or rcFSH beta alpha for the standard curves. The standard curves for cLH paralleled those of pituitary extracts of the homologous fish and also those of other cyprinids species like the black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus), goldfish (Carassius auratus), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). We used the specific antibodies raised against cFSH and cLH to study the specific localization of the different GTH cells in the pituitary of carp and its taxonomic relative species - the zebrafish. Both FSH and LH cells are localized in the center of the proximal pars distalis enveloping both sides of the neurohypophysis. LH cells form a continuous population throughout the PPD, while FSH cells are more loosely distributed throughout the same area and form small aggregations. Marked annual changes were encountered in gonadosomatic index (GSI), follicle diameter, mRNA levels and protein levels of FSH and LH. From September to November, all fish had low GSI, and the ovary contained previtellogenic follicles. From December, the GSI level increased and remained high until March, the follicular diameter reached its maximum in January, where the ovary contained large fully grown follicles. Thereafter, spawning occurred through March and April and ended in May, and GSI level and follicle diameter increased again; and the ovary contained mid-vitellogenic follicles. LH pituitary content and mRNA levels were low at pre- and early vitellogenesis, increasing gradually during this process to reach a peak of LH mRNA levels in mid vitellogenic ovary and a peak of LH content in fully grown ovarian follicles. However, no significant change occurred in FSH pituitary content and mRNA levels in vitellogenic fish and in fish during final maturation stages. A dramatic difference was found in the total content of each gonadotropin in the pituitary, with higher LH than FSH. Moreover, follicle diameter was positively and significantly correlated with LH pituitary content and its transcript levels - but not with the pituitary content or mRNA levels of FSH. Taken together, these results indicate that in carp, LH alone is sufficient to regulate both vitellogenesis and final oocyte maturation while FSH may have another, yet undefined role.

Simple log-linear models best described the relative swim speed to fatigue relationships for both species. Under these conditions, the swimming performances of adult bighead and silver carp were similar to several species of adult fishes native to the Mississippi River system, but relatively low (<3 total body lengths per second, TL/s) compared to previously studied juveniles and sub-adult bigheaded carps (3-15TL/s). The decline in endurance with water velocity was three times greater in bighead carp (slope=-2.98) than in silver carp (slope=-1.01) and the predictive ability of the bighead model was appreciably better than the silver carp model. The differences in adult swimming performance between the two species were coincident with behavioral differences (e.g. breaching in silver carp but not in bighead carp).

The O-CNDs were simply produced via a one-pot hydrothermal treatment of rhodamine B. The detection mechanism was based on the interaction between O-CNDs and MG, where the fluorescence of O-CNDs was suppressed by MG via a combined effect of inner filter effect (IFE) and dynamic suppressing.

To ascertain the effects of inulin, microbial transglutaminase (MTGase) and the combination of inulin/MTGase on gel formation of silver carp surimi, the gel strength, textural properties, water-holding capacity (WHC), dynamic rheological measurements, Raman spectroscopy, light microscopy of gel structure and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of gels from different groups were analyzed. The results showed that addition of inulin, MTGase and MTGase + inulin improved gel strength (increased by 7.7%, 26.8% and 38.56% compared with control group), textural properties and WHC. Raman spectroscopy proven that MTGase + inulin promoted the conversion of α-helixes to β-sheets and β-turns compared with other experimental and control groups. Pure surimi gelation contained a loose and non-heterogeneous network via light microscopy. With the addition of MTGase and inulin, the microstructure of surimi gelation became more compact and homogeneous, particularly the MTGase + inulin groups. Moreover, The SDS-PAGE pattern further disclosed that the MTGase + inulin had a weakened myosin heavy chain band, indicating that inulin could enhance the cross-linking effects of MTGase on myosin heavy chains.

FBBP preparation was obtained by papain treatment of minced bones and centrifugal ultrafiltration, and the molecular weight (MW) distribution was characterized by size exclusion and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). In vitro assessment of the effect of FBBP pretreatment in UVB-irradiated L929 fibroblasts and HaCaT keratinocytes revealed their cytoprotective activity. Their capacity to efficiently reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lipid peroxidation varied in a dose-dependent manner, and it was greater in fibroblasts. A decrease of proinflammatory cytokines secretion, in particular of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), was found after FBBP pretreatment of THP-1-derived inflamed macrophages. Melanin production and tyrosinase activity investigated in UVB-irradiated Mel-Juso cells were lowered in direct relation to FBBP concentrations. FBBP fractions with high radical scavenging activity were separated by ion exchange chromatography, and two collagenic sequences were identified. All these results offer new scientific data on aquaculture fish bone-derived peptides confirming their ability to control the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and pigmentation processes developed during UV irradiation of skin cells and recommend their use as valuable natural ingredients of photoprotective cosmeceutical products.",no

Uchida",2021,Inequality in the distribution of cs-137 contamination within freshwater fish bodies and its affecting factors,Scientific Reports,11,1,,"Contamination of freshwater fishes with Cs-137 remains as a serious problem in Japan, nearly 10 years after the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident, but there is limited information on the distribution of Cs-137 contamination in fish bodies. The Cs-137 distribution can be used for the estimation of internal radiation exposure through the consumption of fish and for the dose estimation of fish themselves. In this study, the Cs-137 distribution in the bodies of 8 freshwater fish species was investigated as percentages of total body burden for fish inhabiting Lake Inba. Fish samples were caught in stake nets placed close to the shore approximately once a month. After the measurement of body length and fresh weight, the radioactivities of Cs-137 in muscle, internal organs, spawn, milt and bone were assayed using high-purity germanium detectors. Analysis of all fish samples showed that the Cs-137 distribution was highest in muscle (54 +/- 12%), followed by internal organs (7.8 +/- 4.6%), spawn (7.4 +/- 5.4%), milt (3.2 +/- 2.1%) and bone (1.2 +/- 0.58%). Among fish species, the highest proportion of 137 Cs in muscle was detected in largemouth bass (71 +/- 1 3%), followed by snakehead (69 +/- 14%), channel catfish (63 +/- 17%), common carp (62 +/- 14%), barbel steed (58 +/- 6.5%), silver carp (57 +/- 7.7%), bluegill (53 +/- 4.7%), and crucian carp (50 +/- 10%). These results suggested that the 137 Cs in muscle was likely to be high in piscivorous fishes compared to omnivorous fishes, especially crucian carp. The proportion of Cs-137 in muscle of crucian carp was not explained either by body length or fresh weight. However, a positive correlation was found between the proportion of Cs-137 in muscle and the condition factor which was an indicator of nutritional status calculated from a length-weight relationship. This correlation implied that more Cs-137 accumulated in muscle tissue of a fish species with high nutritional status. This is the first study to show that condition factor is more important than body length and wet weight in explaining the high proportion of Cs-137 in muscle tissues, at least for crucian carp.",no

Silver carp is one of the most abundant freshwater fish speciesin the world. However, the rapid quality degradation soon after post-mortem makes them highly putrefactive while reducing the nutritional attributes. In this regard, our study aimed at applying organic acids to extend shelf-life of silver carp fish while investigating the quality attributes such as sensory, peroxide values, pH and microbial loads of the fish fillets during 9 days of refrigerated temperature storage (40C). Acetic acid and ascorbic acid are found to have strong antibacterial activities against different microorganisms. Fish fillets samples were treated with alone or in combination with acetic acid and ascorbic acid spray while keeping one group of fish fillets untreated. Total Viable Count (TVC) was found greater in the samples kept untreated and treated alone with acetic acid and ascorbic acid. However, fish fillets treated with acetic acid and ascorbic acid in combination were reported with lesser number of microbial counts. Moreover, Peroxide Value (PV) and pH were significantly lower in the sample treated with in combination of acetic acid and ascorbic acid. Sensory analysis revealed that fish fillets treated with combined treatment had better quality retention at the end of 9 days storage period. The findings suggest that the application of acetic acid and ascorbic acid alone or in different combination have the potential to decrease microbial loads while facilitating the shelf-life of fish fillets during 9 days of refrigerated temperature (40C) storage period.",no

To assess the likelihood of BHC establishment and their likely effects on the food web of Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, we developed a multi-species individual-based bioenergetics model that tracks individual bighead and silver carp, four key fish species, and seven prey biomass groups over 50 years. The model tracks the daily consumption, mortality and growth of all individuals and the biomass dynamics of interacting prey pools. We ran simulation scenarios to determine the likelihood of BHC establishment under initial introductions from 5 to 1 million yearling and older individuals, and assuming variable age-0 carp survival rates (high, intermediate, and low). We bounded the survival of age-0 BHC as recruitment continues to be one of the biggest unknowns. We also simulated the potential effects of an established population of 1 million bighead carp or silver carp assuming variation in age-0 survival. Results indicated that as few as 10 BHC could establish a population assuming high or intermediate age-0 survival, but at least 100,000 individuals were needed to establish a population assuming low age-0 survival. BHC had negative effects on plankton and planktivorous fish biomass, which increased with BHC density. However, piscivorous walleye Sander vitreus appeared to benefit from BHC establishment. The potential for BHC to establish and affect ecologically and economically important fish species in Saginaw Bay is a cause for concern.",no

Using the principle of greenhouse mediated raised temperature, the issue has been addressed by examining the growth responses of some tropical fishes in polyculture (rohu, mrigal, bata, Japanese punti, grass carp, common carp, magur, freshwater prawn) and two stocking ratios (80: 20 and 20: 80) with surface and column feeder (catla, silver carp, rohu, Japanese punti and bata) and bottom feeder (mrigal and common carp). Advanced fry of these fishes were introduced separately in solar heated greenhouse and in open polyhouse (13 x 1.5 x 2m(3)) placed in triplicate in a pond and reared for 120 or 98 days during the winter for two consecutive years. The rate of survival (20-83%) and net weight gained by different species of fish were distinctly higher in closed set up (0.22-2.95 g/day) than in open (4-66%; 0.11-1.80 g/day) ones in both trials. Among the species, warmth induced net weight gain was maximal for Japanese punti (196 g), followed by rohu (159 g), mrigal (115 g), grass carp (104 g), bata (36 g) and freshwater prawn (28 g) in polyculture. The frequency distribution of harvested fishes was skewed towards large fishes in solar heated greenhouse and smaller ones in open units. Water temperature ranged from 21.6-28.1 degrees C and 17.2-23.7 degrees C in the closed and open units, whereas mean temperature remained 4.5-5 degrees C higher in the former than in latter. There was no marked differences in total alkalinity (219-231 mg/l), inorganic carbon (289-417 mg/l), organic carbon (4.27-4.52 mg/l), dissolved oxygen (6.61-6.75 mg/l), total dissolved solids (420.48-423.74 mg/l) and conductivity (549.83-563.29 mu s/cm) between the closed and open enclosures, and remained within the range for fish culture. The score values of the sum total of the integrated ecological conditions revealed that similar to 5 degrees C rise in water temperature during winter enhanced as high as 36% increased yield of fish (2546 kg/ha) over open units mediated through microbial driven augmented manure mineralization leading to increased primary productivity, zooplankton abundance and ecological integrity. In essence, the solar heated greenhouse would be of considerable use for circumventing the retarded growth during winter in tropical fishes.",no

The lethal exposure significantly deteriorated the Ucrit of silver carps while the non-lethal exposure did not. Water temperature also impacted fish's swimming ability in TDG supersaturated water. The results can provide a reference for fish conservation during flood discharge. During flood discharges of upstream dams in the Yangtze River, the pelagic fish have a stress risk from total dissolved gas (TDG) supersaturation in the river water. This study took the silver carp as the object and systematically evaluated the effects of TDG supersaturation levels and exposure time on their critical swimming speed (Ucrit) at different temperatures. The external symptoms of gas bubble disease were found when TDG levels exceeded 130%. Both exposure time and TDG level did not significantly impact the Ucrit of fish under 6 days of non-lethal exposure (110%, 120%, 130% TDG) with lower or higher water temperature. Significant differences in Ucrit were found among different exposure times at 11.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C under 10 hours of lethal exposure (135%, 140%, 150% TDG) and the Ucrit reduced by 59.88%, 83.32%, and 92.40%, respectively. TDG level had a significant impact on the Ucrit at 21.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C when exposure time exceeded 8 hours. Ucrit at 21.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C water were significantly greater than those at 11.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C water where conditions had the same TDG supersaturation and exposure time. Differences in Ucrit between temperatures ranged from 3.24 to 6.12 BL/s under non-lethal exposure and from 6.38 to 13.88 BL/s under lethal exposure.

Settling characteristics are different depending on the physical and biological properties (such as density, diameter and surface viscosity). In this study, the terminal settling velocities of the floating eggs of four carps at different water hardening stages were measured. The terminal settling velocities of the eggs gradually decreased with water hardening process. The terminal settling velocity of the eggs of bighead carp was highest, followed by black carp, silver carp and grass carp. Subsequently, an empirical formula describing the relationship between the drag coefficient and the Reynolds number was developed. The applicability of this formula was investigated in drifting experiments. We proposed a formula for calculating the drag coefficient of floating fish eggs. The drag coefficient formula of the floating fish eggs is suitable for the Reynolds numbers below 490. At Reynolds numbers > 490, the drag coefficient was about 0.12. The results show that floating fish eggs differ significantly from other solid particles in their behavior and an own formula is necessary. This is the first study on the drag coefficient of the floating fish eggs. It further provides new insight on the movement of floating fish eggs in water and can be used in numerical simulation to describe the transport of floating fish eggs, essential for carp protection.",no

The results of transverse relaxation time showed less immobile water and free water converted into bound water in a matrix subjected to the setting process. Scanning electron microscope and light microscopy images revealed inefficient starch-swelling in two-step heated gels. Chemical interactions and forces in direct cooking gels were more vulnerable to starch addition, resulting in significant decreases in hydrophobic interaction and sulfhydryl content (p < 0.05). With the increment of starch, the disulfide stretching vibrations of the gauche-gauche-gauche conformation were reduced in both gel matrices. The structural variations of different components collectively resulted in changes in texture profile analysis and water holding capacity.

Integrated animal components such as poultry birds and fish also supplement the system with weed control. The role and efficacy of these animal components as tools for managing weedy rice (Oryza sativa L.) were explored, as weedy rice infestation is increasing. This threat of weedy rice is due to scarcity of water resulting from poor water management and improper field leveling. Grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella val.) produced the highest reduction of weedy rice biomass, 28% within 24 h under laboratory conditions.

Rapid assessments may be possible through the application of a combination of bioenergetic and population dynamic models.Paddlefish (Polyodon spathula) is a native species in the central USA with a history of population decline due to waterway development and overharvesting for roe. It is not known whether paddlefish are impacted by resource competition from invasive bigheaded carp populations, including silver (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis), which have expanded dramatically in the Mississippi River.We used bioenergetic models to project the potential impact of invasive silver and bighead carp on zooplankton density and paddlefish somatic growth in backwater habitat. Bioenergetic outputs were translated to impacts on fecundity, becoming inputs for 50‐year metapopulation simulations of backwater habitat connected to the main‐stem Mississippi River by episodic flood events.Competition with carp reduced growth and increased the risk of population decline for paddlefish. Impacts increased disproportionately with increased carp abundance and were further exacerbated in scenarios with increased diet overlap or decreased zooplankton abundance.We also analysed paddlefish condition data collected at sites near the lower Mississippi River with varying histories of carp invasion. These data give credence to the bioenergetic model output; paddlefish had reduced body condition at sites with long‐established, high‐density carp populations.We conclude that invasive bigheaded carps have great potential to reduce paddlefish growth, fecundity, and abundance. The pairing of bioenergetics and population models is likely to be broadly useful in assessing the risks posed by other invasive species.",no

Microbial diversity was significantly higher in the habitat samples (water and sediment) than in the fish host samples (gill and gut) and was significantly higher in the gills than in the gut. Both body niche (i.e., gill vs gut) and host species significantly impacted the fish-associated microbiota, but permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and cluster analysis of core taxa indicated that the effect of body niche outweighed that of the host species in influencing the microbial community. Host microbial communities were more similar to the water microbiota than the sediment microbiota. Source tracking analysis further confirmed that water had a greater contribution than sediment to the fish microbiota, consistent with their upper water-layer habitats. The gill and gut possessed unique core microbiota and predictive functions in comparison to the surrounding environment. These findings should improve our understanding of the composition, diversity, and function of aquatic",no

A total of 137 phytoplankton species belonging to 8 divisions were recorded indicating rich phytoplankton diversity in the North Indian reservoir. Bacillariophyta contributed the highest number of species followed by Chlorophyta. Filamentous algae such as Geitlerinema sp., Pseudoanabaena sp., Oscillatoria sp. and Phormidium sp. were highly abundant. The contribution of the top ten species ranged between 63% and 98% of total phytoplankton density. PCA analysis of physico-chemical revealed six principal components (HCO3, TDS, BOD, DOM, air temperature and pH) which significantly affected the succession of phytoplankton in Jargo Reservoir. The CCA analysis of phytoplankton species and physico-chemical parameters revealed that Ochrophyta and Miozoa were highly influenced by high CO2 and PO4. Higher phytoplankton diversity and species richness were observed during the late winter season and rainy season, respectively. Our investigation recommends that fish production in the reservoir could be enhanced by stocking with fingerlings of silver carp, which has the potential to utilise the unconsumed population of abundant Myxophyta.",no

Fish parasites proliferate quickly in favourable settings, compromising fish health and frequently resulting in high mortality. Identifying and implementing appropriate control techniques is the need of the hour to combat the diseases. Emamectin benzoate (EMB) is an efficient infeed therapy for ectoparasite control in fish. The aim of the present study was to determine the withdrawal period of EMB in silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) commercially important fish species in southeast Asia. The depletion of EMB residues in silver carp muscle treated with a dose of 50 mu g kg(-1) body weight (BW) day(-1) for seven consecutive days was assessed. Muscle tissue was sampled on the 7th day of EMB feeding and 1st-, 3rd-, 7th-, 14th-, 21st-, 35th- and 41st-day post-medication (PM) for QTRAP 4000 LC-MS/MS analysis. The data revealed that the level of EMB in the fish muscle was 13.0 +/- 0.1 parts per billion (ppb) on the 0th day of withdrawal. The residue levels were reduced significantly on the 3rd day, with traces of EMB recorded by 21st-day PM and reached undetectable levels by 31st day PM. Considering the maximum residue limit (MRL) of 100 mu g kg(-1) for fish muscle, the present study's findings support the usage of EMB in silver carp under the conditions employed in the study. The current study provides crucial information on the use of EMB as an antiparasiticide in silver carp, considering the food safety issues.",no

In case of Lake Balaton, irreversible changes include the reduction of lake level and subsequent construction directly on the lakeshore as well as introduction of foreign species such as eel and silver carp. Reasons for the negative results/impacts of the introduced interventions are: insufficient level of technical or scientific knowledge at the time of planning and implementation; poor decision support systems and mechanisms; insufficient consultation with local people and experts of other fields; lack of integrated approach, both in terms of territorial and interdisciplinary aspects; and pursuing of short term economic or political benefits. Compared to the situation one and a half centuries ago, many of the reasons leading to adverse effects can be eliminated because technical and scientific knowledge is increasing with high speed and huge amount of monitoring, etc. data are becoming available; decision support systems and mechanisms are getting faster and are improving in complexity; consultation with, participation, and empowerment of local people, stakeholders and a diverse choice of experts are becoming basic requirements in environmental and spatial development policy; integrated approaches both in terms of territorial and interdisciplinary aspects are gathering momentum.

Bigheaded carp were accidentally introduced into the lower Mississippi River basin in the early 1970s and have since invaded many water bodies in the Midwestern United States. Evidence of bigheaded carp reproduction and recruitment in the upper Mississippi River upstream of Lock and Dam 19 (LD19) at Keokuk, Iowa, thought to be a critical constriction point to their upstream establishment, has been limited to a few isolated detections of eggs, larvae, and juvenile life stages since 2012. Therefore, a more comprehensive assessment of bigheaded carp reproduction in this critical management zone was needed. We used quadrafoil light traps (n = 1,387) deployed during May-September 2016-2018 in Pools 17-19 of the Mississippi River to monitor for advanced larval bigheaded carp in low-velocity habitats. Throughout the sampling period, we captured 1,747 larval and 35 postlarval bigheaded carp (N = 1,782). Bigheaded carp were collected on 15 sampling events that spanned from May 31, 2016, to September 13, 2018, with associated hatch dates estimated to represent 10 unique reproductive events from May 2016 to September 2018. The individual captures and backdated hatch estimates revealed a protracted spawning period of up to seven events in 2016, one event in 2017, and two events in 2018. Bigheaded carp were only captured in Pool 19, possibly due to the drifting requirements for egg maturation and the low-velocity downstream reach of Pool 19. This research provides confirmation that bigheaded carp spawned upstream of LD19 are capable of transitioning past the yolk sac stage upstream of this bottleneck to more advanced larval stages. Knowledge of reproduction and larval retention and the field-based evidence of protracted spawning fill critical research gaps needed for the management of bigheaded carp.",no

Despite observed F1 hybrid superiority in experimental settings, effects of postzygotic selection on bighead and silver carp hybrids have not been tested in a natural system. Individual parent and hybrid genotypes were resolved at 57 species‐specific loci and used to evaluate postzygotic selection for body condition (Wr) and female reproductive potential (presence of spawning stage gonads and gonadosomatic index [GSI]) in the MRB during 2009–2011. Body condition in the Marseilles Reach, Illinois River declined with a decrease in species‐specific allele frequency from 1.0 to 0.4 for each species and early generation hybrids (F1, F2, and first‐generation backcross) had lower mean Wr than late generation hybrids (2nd+ generation backcrosses) and parentals. Proportions of stage IV and stage V (spawning stage) female gonads differed between bighead and silver carp, but not among parentals and their early and late generation hybrids within the MRB. Mean GSI values did not differ between parentals and hybrids. Because reproductive potential did not differ between hybrids and parentals, our results suggest that early generation hybrids occur in low frequency either as a factor of poor condition (Wr) and postreproductive survival, infrequent reproductive encounters by parental bighead and silver carp, or selection pressures acting on juvenile or immature life stages. Our results suggest that a combination of genetic and environmental factors may contribute to the postzygotic success of bighead and silver carp hybrids in the Mississippi River Basin.",no

We tested varying concentrations of different inhibitors (humic, phytic, and tannic acids; crude leaf extracts) for impacts on quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays designed for eDNA surveys of bighead and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). We also tested for inhibition by high concentrations of exogenous DNA, hypothesizing that DNA from increasingly closely related species would be increasingly inhibitory. All tested inhibitors impacted qPCR, though only at very high concentrations - likely a function, in part, of having used an inhibitor-resistant qPCR solution. Closer phylogenetic relatedness resulted in inhibition at lower exogenous DNA concentrations, but not at relatively close phylogenetic scales. Inhibition was also influenced by the qPCR reporter dye used. Importantly, different qPCR assays responded differently to the same inhibitor concentrations. Implications of these results are that the inclusion of more than one assay for the same target taxa in an eDNA survey may be an important countermeasure against false negatives and that internal positive controls may not, in the absence of efforts to maximize inhibition compatibility, provide useful information about the inhibition of an eDNA assay.",no

However, in order for eDNA monitoring to mature as a research and management tool, there are several critical knowledge gaps that must be filled. One such gap is the fate of eDNA materials in the aquatic environment. Understanding the environmental factors that influence the decay of eDNA and how these factors impact detection probabilities over time and space could have significant implications for eDNA survey design and data interpretation. Here we experimentally explore decay of eDNA associated with bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) biological waste collected from an aquaculture filtration system and with sperm collected from captive silver carp (H. molitrix), and how decay may be influenced by differing levels of water turbulence, temperature, microbial load, and pH. We found that the decay patterns of eDNA associated with both H. nobilis biological waste and H. molitrix milt significantly fit monophasic exponential decay curves. Secondly, we observed that the highest temperature we tested resulted in a decay half-life as much as 5.5× more rapid than the lowest temperature we tested. When we suppressed microbial loads in eDNA samples, we observed that overall losses of eDNA were reduced by about 2.5×. When we amended eDNA samples with pond water the half-life of eDNA was reduced by about 2.25×, despite relatively little apparent increase in the overall microbial load. This pattern indicated that species constituency of the microbial community, in addition to microbial load, might play a critical role in eDNA degradation. A shift in pH from 6.5 to 8.0 in the samples resulted in a 1.6× reduction in eDNA half-life. Water turbulence in our study had no apparent effect on eDNA decay. When we combined different temperature, pH, and microbial load treatments to create a rapid decay condition and a slow decay condition, and tracked eDNA decay over 91 days, we observed a 5.0× greater loss of eDNA by Day 5 under rapid decay conditions than under slow decay conditions. At the end of the trials, the differences in eDNA loss between the rapid decay and baseline and slow decay conditions were 0.1× and 3.3×, respectively. Our results strongly demonstrate the potential for environmental factors to influence eDNA fate and, thus, the interpretation of eDNA survey results.",no

Previously published evidence for spawning of these species in the upper Mississippi River has been limited to an area just downstream of Dam 22 (near Saverton, Missouri). In 2013 and 2014, we sampled ichthyoplankton at 18 locations in the upper Mississippi River main stem from Dam 9 through Dam 19 and in four tributaries of the Mississippi River (Des Moines, Skunk, Iowa, and Wisconsin rivers). We identified eggs and larvae by using morphological techniques and then used genetic tools to confirm species identity. The spawning events we observed often included more than one species of Asian carp and in a few cases included eggs that must have been derived from more than one upstream spawning event. The upstream extent of genetically confirmed Grass Carp ichthyoplankton was the Wisconsin River, while Bighead Carp and Silver Carp ichthyoplankton were observed in Pool 16. In all these cases, ichthyoplankton likely drifted downstream for several hours prior to collection. Higher water velocities (and, to a lesser extent, higher temperatures) were associated with an increased likelihood of observing eggs or larvae, although the temperature range we encountered was mostly above 17 degrees C. Several major spawning events were detected in 2013, but no major spawning events were observed in 2014. The area between Dam 15 and Dam 19 appears to be the upstream edge of spawning activity for both Silver Carp and Bighead Carp, suggesting that this area could be a focal point for management efforts designed to limit further upstream movement of these species.""",no

Invasive species may display reproductive strategies that allow successful reproduction in varying environments, such as batch and protracted spawning. Bighead Carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and Silver Carp H. molitrix, referred to as bigheaded carp, are invasive species that have been introduced worldwide. In some invaded ranges, they either have a protracted spawning period and/or spawn multiple times in a season, which can be advantageous in novel environments. Reproductive strategies can vary between river systems or with environmental conditions, and understanding differences in strategies can improve management of bigheaded carp. To determine reproductive strategy, we evaluated the histology of spawning capable ovaries from Silver Carp (n = 58) and Bighead Carp (n = 38) collected during May-September 2016 and June 2017 from Pools 17-20 of the upper Mississippi River (UMR). We found that 87.9% of Silver Carp (n = 51) and 86.8% of Bighead Carp (n = 33) had an ovary that contained primary growth, cortical alveolar, and vitellogenic oocytes simultaneously. Multiple stages of oocytes within an ovary indicated that individuals were capable of spawning multiple times during a single year, and the presence of postovulatory follicle complexes demonstrated that individuals had already spawned while oocytes were still present. Based on histological samples, bigheaded carp appear to be indeterminate batch spawners, with oocytes continuing to develop throughout the spawning period. Silver and Bighead carp in the UMR may exhibit protracted and batch spawning and employ flexible spawning strategies among different river systems, which can increase the probability of successful recruitment in a variable environment.",no

Understanding the reproductive potential (fecundity and egg size) of low-density, leading-edge populations is important to inform the management of Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Bighead Carp H. nobilis populations in the upper Mississippi River. Therefore, we compared batch fecundity and eggs/g of ovary subsample (an egg-size surrogate) of Silver Carp (n = 145) and Bighead Carp (n = 75) along a decreasing invasion gradient from Pool 20 (higher abundance) to Pool 17 (lower abundance) in the Mississippi River. Bighead Carp in Pools 17 and 18 (461 +/- 22 eggs/g [mean +/- SE]) had significantly fewer eggs/g than those in Pools 19 and 20 (higher abundance; 483 +/- 13 eggs/g). Log-transformed batch fecundity for Bighead Carp was positively correlated to log-transformed fish length, and batch fecundity was higher in Pools 17, 18, and 19 than in Pool 20. The eggs/g values for Silver Carp, which have been previously shown to be independent of fish length, were similar among all pools (94 +/- 11 eggs/g). Batch fecundity for Silver Carp was significantly higher in Pools 17-19 than in Pool 20, where densities are higher. Our results suggest that at lower densities, Bighead Carp produce more, larger eggs and Silver Carp produce more eggs, which collectively could increase their reproductive success along invasion fronts.",no

Therefore, the ability to estimate fecundity from field measurements (i.e., TL, relative weight [W-r], or ovary weight) can be a valuable tool for fisheries managers to estimate reproductive potential. The goal of this study was to relate the batch fecundity of invasive Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Bighead Carp H. nobilis to metrics that can be quickly measured to eliminate the need for direct enumeration. Silver and Bighead carp were collected from the upper Mississippi River (UMR) in the summer of 2016 and 2017. Subsamples of mature (spawning capable) ovaries were preserved, enumerated, and then related to ovary weight, TL, weight, and W-r. An equation for estimating Silver Carp batch fecundity from ovary weight in the UMR, corrected for ovary membrane weight, was developed: {ovary weight - [0.222 x (ovary weight(0.7589))]} x 794 (SE = 11). Batch fecundity for Silver Carp from Pools 17-20 of the UMR averaged 1,230,930 +/- 68,983 eggs (mean +/- SE). Ovary weight was the strongest predictor of fecundity, but TL, weight, and W-r also showed significant relationships with fecundity for Silver Carp. Batch fecundity for Bighead Carp averaged 1,043,953 +/- 82,360 eggs, but the number of eggs per gram showed significant spatial variation; therefore, no fecundity equation was developed for this species. Future work should evaluate the frequency of Silver Carp spawns within a season and how batch fecundity varies among multiple spawning events. Fecundity estimates can be used to determine spawning potential ratios, which can help in evaluating management strategies.",no

In the past decades, bighead and silver carp have been introduced from the Yangtze River to many river systems in China, including the Pearl River, in annual, large‐scale, stocking activities to enhance wild fisheries. Nonetheless, few studies have assessed the ecological or genetic impacts of such introductions on native conspecific fish populations. An mtDNA D‐loop segment of 978 bp from 213 bighead carp samples from 9 populations and a 975 bp segment from 204 silver carp samples from 10 populations were obtained to evaluate genetic diversity and population integrity. Results from a haplotype network analysis revealed that most haplotypes of the Pearl River clustered with those of Yangtze River origin and only a small proportion were distinct, suggesting that both the native Pearl River bighead and silver carp populations are currently dominated by genetic material from the Yangtze River. The genetic diversity of Pearl River populations is high in both species because of this inter‐population gene flow, but the diversity of native Pearl River populations is low. To preserve the native genetic diversity, stocking of non‐native fingerlings should cease immediately and native Pearl River bighead and silver carp fish farms should be established. This research demonstrates the danger to native biodiversity across China because of the substantial, ongoing stock‐enhancement activities without prior genetic assessment.",no

We present a three-dimensional Lagrangian particle tracking model that uses fully resolved river hydrodynamics and a continuous random walk algorithm driven by local turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate. We incorporate a new set of equations to compute evolving egg characteristics with fully resolved 3-D hydrodynamics. To demonstrate the performance of the model, we conducted a case study in an eight-kilometer reach of the Missouri River at the discharge of approximately 25% daily flow exceedance. Three-dimensional river hydrodynamics was modeled, calibrated, and evaluated with measurement data. Egg drift was modeled and compared using fully three-dimensional, depth-averaged two-dimensional, and zone-averaged one-dimensional hydrodynamics. The comparison shows a generally good agreement among models of downstream egg transport due to advection but a different dispersion pattern of eggs in the river, as a result of turbulent diffusion and shear induced dispersion.",no

Aeromonas hydrophila (A. hydrophila) is the most common zoonotic pathogen in aquaculture, which causes serious economic losses to aquaculture, especially to bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, H. nobilis) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, H. molitrix). Recent studies along with our previous findings have shown that synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing CpG motifs (CpG ODN) can play a good role in aquatic animals against infection. In order to clarify the relationship between CpG ODN and RBP4 under A. hydrophila infection, firstly, full-length RBP4 cDNAs from H. nobilis and H. molitrix were cloned. And characteristics of RBP4, including sequence and structure, tissue distribution and genetic evolution were analyzed. In addition, mRNA expression levels of RBP4, cytokine, toll-like receptors (TLRs), morbidity and survival rates of H. nobilis and H. molitrix were observed post CpG ODN immunization or following challenge. The results indicated that hn/hm_RBP4 (RBP4 genes obtained from H. nobilis and H. molitrix) had the highest homology with Megalobrama amblycephala. Distribution data showed that the expression level of hn_RBP4 mRNA was higher than that of hm_RBP4. After CpG ODN immunization followed by A.hydrophila challenge, significantly higher survival was observed in both carps, together with up-regulated RBP4 expression. Meanwhile, hn/hm_IL-1β level was relatively flat (and decreased), hn/hm_IFN-γ, hn/hm_TLR4 and hn/hm_TLR9 levels increased significantly, but hn/hm_STRA6 showed no significant change, compared with control. Moreover, CpG ODN immunization could induce stronger immune protective responses (higher IFN-γ/gentle IL-1β level and lower morbidity/higher survival rate) against A. hydrophila in H. nobilis, along with higher RBP4 level, when compared with that in H. molitrix. These results demonstrated that RBP4 was well involved in the immune protection of CpG ODN. Based on the results, we speculated that in the case of A. hydrophila infection, TLR9 signaling pathway was activated by CpG ODN. Subsequently, CpG ODN up-regulated RBP4, and RBP4 activated TLR4 signaling pathway. Then TLR4 and TLR9 synergistically improved the anti-infection responses.

Importantly, some of the emerging OPEs, i.e., tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphate (TDtBPP), 4-tert-butylphenyl diphenyl phosphate (BPDP), and 2-isopropylphenyl diphenyl phosphate (IPDP), exhibited greater or at least comparable contamination levels as compared to traditional ones. There were no statistically significant interspecies (n = 6) differences regarding OPE concentrations. However, we observed significant differences on OPE concentrations among different tissues of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), for which the intestine has the highest OPE mean concentration (46.5 ng/g wet weight (ww)), followed by the liver (20.1 ng/g ww) approximate to brain (20.0 ng/g ww) > gill (14.8 ng/g ww) > muscle (11.4 ng/g ww). An interesting exception is IPDP, which presents an unexpectedly high concentration in the brain (0.510 ng/g ww). Collectively, this study expands our understanding of OPE contamination in wild fish and clearly shows that emerging TDtBPP, IPDP, and BPDP could play an equally important role as traditional OPEs in contribution of OPE pollution in wild fish samples.",no

In this study, hepatic biochemical activity indices in serum and the content of major neurotransmitters in the brain were altered markedly after acute hypoxia and reoxygenation exposure in silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). Proteomics analysis of the liver showed that a number of immune-related and cytoskeletal organization-related proteins were downregulated, the ferroptosis pathway was activated, and several antioxidant molecules and detoxifying enzymes were upregulated. Proteomics analysis of the brain showed that somatostatin-1A (SST1A) was upregulated, dopamine-degrading enzyme catechol O methyltransferase (COMT) and ferritin, heavy subunit (FerH) were downregulated, and the levels of proteins involved in the nervous system were changed in different ways. In conclusion, these findings highlight that hypoxia-reoxygenation has potential adverse effects on growth, locomotion, immunity, and reproduction of silver carp, and represents a serious threat to liver and brain function, possibly via ferroptosis, oxidative stress, and cytoskeleton destruction in the liver, and abnormal expression of susceptibility genes for neurodegenerative disorders in the brain. Our present findings provide clues to the mechanisms of hypoxia and reoxygenation damage in the brain and liver of hypoxia-sensitive fish. They could also be used to develop methods to reduce hypoxia or reoxygenation injury to fish.",no

Both groups were maintained at 25 degrees C and, at the end of the experimental period, the total movement distance (TMD), percent time spent moving (PTM), ventilation frequency (V-f), pre-exercise oxygen consumption (M(center dot)O-2) and EPOC response of the experimental fish were measured. The TMD and PTM obtained for the control group of southern catfish were lower than those found for the control groups of the three active species. Short-term fasting resulted in decreases in the TMD and PTM of the southern catfish and black carp and increases in the TMD of grass carp and silver carp. The V-f of southern catfish was significantly higher than those of grass carp and silver carp, whereas the latter was also significantly higher than that of black carp. Short-term fasting resulted in significant increases in the V-f and decreases in the pre-exercise M(center dot)O-2 of southern catfish and silver carp. Southern catfish and black carp exhibited lower peak postexercise M(center dot)O-2 and recovery rates, and relatively higher EPOC magnitudes than grass carp and silver carp. Short-term fasting exerted no significant effects on the peak post-exercise M(center dot)O-2, but resulted in relatively higher EPOC magnitudes in the four fish species. These results suggest that (1) different fish species exhibit significantly different levels of spontaneous activity and post-exercise M(center dot)O-2 profiles with different characteristics and that (2) short-term fasting exerts different effects on the level of spontaneous activity in four fish species with different foraging strategies.",no

The tested aquaculture models included monoculture of largemouth bass (MC), polyculture of largemouth bass, gibel carp Carassius auratus gibelio and silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (PC), and integrated culture of largemouth bass, gibel carp, silver carp and freshwater pearl mussel Hyriopsis cumingii (IC). The ratio of largemouth bass, gibel carp and silver carp was 30:2:1 in the PC model, and the ratio of largemouth bass, gibel carp, silver carp and mussel was 30:2:1:5 in the IC model. The largemouth bass were fed with formulated feed twice daily. No significant differences were found in weight gain and yield of largemouth bass, total fish yield, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) utilization efficiencies, N and P wastes, pH, nitrite, nitrate, reactive phosphate, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total organic carbon, chemical oxygen demand, 5‐day biochemical oxygen demand, chlorophyll a, primary productivity among the MC, PC and IC models. The ammonia was lower, while the dissolved oxygen was higher in the PC tanks than in the MC tanks.

With adding amount of TGase increasing, the crosslinking degree of surimi gels increased, the surface hydrophobicity reduced progressively, and high molecular polymers formed. The relationship between content of free amino acids and digestion time of surimi gels showed an S-shaped curve and could fit the Logistic equation (x = Mx(0)/x(0)+(M-x(0))e(-kMt)) well (R-2=0.957-0.998). There were two digestion modes of surimi gels induced by different amounts of TGase. The time that reached to the maximum digestibility was prolonged with the increase of TGase adding amount. The results suggested that adding proper amount TGase to surimi was conducive to sustained release of nutrients and a theoretical foundation of surimi gels gastric digestion was built for surimi industry.",no

There were four treatments with three replicates each: crucian carp (50 fish) fed with low (8.7 g/ kg) or high phosphorous (13.5 g/ kg) diets (L1 and H1), and polyculture (50 crucian carp + 10 silver carp + 10 bighead carp) fed with low or high-phosphorus diets (L3 and H3). Results suggested that polyculture with filter feeders suppresses crucian carp growth, especially when supplied with low phosphorus diet. Polyculture significantly enhanced the total fish production when crucian carp were fed a diet with high P levels. Dietary P level and polyculture with silver and bighead carp did not affect dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, water transparency, NH4+-N, total nitrogen, or any form of phosphorus (p < 0.05), while the presence of filter feeders significantly suppressed plankton. The present experiment suggested that silver carp is more suitable for polyculture with crucian carp, and a higher P level is needed to support plankton and reduce competition with crucian carp.",no

As a pivotal environmental factor that affects fish migration and population distribution, the low‐velocity flow has not drawn enough attention despite its extensive presence in various ecoregions.To understand the behavioural profiles of fish in low‐velocity flow, we examined the motility and swimming performance of two representative cyprinids, grass carp (GC, Ctenopharyngodon idella) and silver carp (SC, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), under the combined effect of different flow velocities and illuminance ranges.The two species were exposed to two flow velocities (0.15 and 0.25 m/s) and three illuminance ranges (100.0–0.9 lx, 300.0–2.5 lx, and 700.0–4.9 lx). A novel behavioural metric, composed of light preference, swimming speed, rheotaxis index (RI), swimming stability (SS), and the probability of moving forwards/backwards over a certain distance (PMf‐0.1 and PMb‐0.1), was developed to fully characterise the motion strategy of fish.By analysing the individual distribution in light gradient, we confirmed the scototaxis of GC and found the oscillating light preference in SC that changed from 84.41–10.18 to 6.00–2.08 lx and disappeared with increasing illuminance. The RI and SS increased at the fast flow velocity (0.25 m/s) for both species, and SC was more forward‐prone and more stable than GC. Despite the fluctuating light preference, the higher illuminances heightened the RI and SS in SC, while in GC, higher illuminances inhibited the SS and had no impact on the RI. The results of PMf‐0.1 and PMb‐0.1 indicated that a higher flow velocity could facilitate the temporary upstream swimming in both species, while illuminance could only promote the same effect in SC.Finally, our study proposed possible manoeuvres in fine‐scale spatio‐temporal scenarios such as attraction flow and non‐traditional passages and provided valuable insights into fish community dynamics, laying the groundwork for alleviating the threat from invasive species and for future fish population recovery.",no

Knowledge of the basic characteristics of fish assemblages in reservoirs is a first step toward the development of effective conservation policies. We used the information collected over a 10-year period (2006-2015) to assess the structure of the fish assemblages in the Three Gorge Reservoir (TGR) in a river-dam gradient. Three fish zones were detected in TGR. Species richness was the highest in the upper zone and lowest in the lower zone. The riverine zones were dominated by rheophilic species Coreius guichenoti and Pelteobagrus vachelli. The transitional zones were dominated by Coreius heterodon and Rhinogobio cylindricus. The lacustrine zones were dominated by eurytopic species Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Aristichthys nobilis, Hemiculter bleekeri and Cvprinus carpio. For the functional characteristics, fish assemblages in riverine and transitional zones were dominated by insectivorous species, equilibrium strategists and rheophilic species (e.g., Coreius heterodon and Coreius guichenoti). In lacustrine zones, the fish assemblage was dominated by habitat generalists common to lakes and reservoirs (e.g., Hemiculter bleekeri, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Aristichthys nobilis). Moreover, 18 exotic species (e.g., Protosalanx hyalocranius, Ictalurus punctatus, Megalobrama amblycephala, Tilapia) were collected in TGR, most of which only existed in the lacustrine zone.

To investigate the relationship between the preferred hydrodynamic characteristics of spawning sites and the response of fish spawning behavior, we monitored the flow field of spawning sites during ecological operation of the Three Gorges Dam (i.e., man-made flood regulation) in 2014 and 2015. We used the data to explore the correlation between vorticity changes in spawning grounds and the spawning amount. Pearson correlation coefficients of the average vorticity in all cross-sections of the Yidu spawning ground and spawning amount in 2014 and 2015 were 0.730 and 0.822, respectively, indicating a significant positive correlation between vorticity and spawning activity. In some specific regions, this correlation was even stronger (Pearson correlations of the regional vorticity and egg production were >0.95). To further corroborate and analyze the relationship between these specific regions and the distribution of broodstock during the breeding season, an ultrasonic telemetry test of broodstock was conducted in the Yidu spawning ground in 2016. The results showed that the broodstocks were concentrated in the reach near the Quantong Pier (~76 km from the Three Gorges Dam). These regions were consistent with areas of river characterized by highly correlated vorticity and egg production levels, suggesting that these regions are areas preferred by four major Chinese carps for spawning.",no

The river basin of Upper Odra is situated in the area of River Odra springs featuring mostly minor streams which are not currently accessible for the migration of fishes from the lower river parts and from the Baltic Sea because of the existence of tens of migration barriers in the area of Poland. There has been actually proved the occurrence of eight non-native fish species the presence of which is, with the exclusions of Carassius gibelio and Pseudorasbora parva, the result of the planned introduction related to the fish management activities. The River Morava basin consists of two parts – the system of the River Morava itself and the entire River Dyje basin. Currently, there are 16 non-native fish species. Apart from the eight species existing also in the Odra river basin, there are also eight other species the existence of which relates to the migration accessibility from the confluence of these two rivers for fishes from the River Danube through the lower part of the River Morava. The species Lepomis gibbosus, Neogobius melanostomus and Proterorhinchus semilunaris were the last ones which have arrived there by themselves. Coregonus maraena and Coregonus peled are bred in fishponds.The basic part of the non-native fishes’ spectrum existing in free waters of the two basins consists of the species which are bred in aquaculture and fishponds (Oncorhyncus mykiss, Salvelinus fontinalis, Ctenopharyngodon idella, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, and Hypophthalmichthys nobilis). These species, with the exception of Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, introduced also into the fishing grounds and especially Oncorhynchus mykiss and Ctenopharyngodon idella make the important fishes for anglers.

Consequently, Asian carp management plans (including contractual harvest) have been implemented to prevent range expansion into vulnerable systems such as the Great Lakes. Asian carp harvest also provides an opportunity to assess if control efforts can benefit native fishes. To answer this question, 26 years of standardized electrofishing data were analyzed, focusing on gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) body condition (Wr) and abundance (catch-per-unit-effort, CPUE) from the Illinois River (Illinois, USA). Gizzard shad data were categorized into pre-Asian carp establishment (1990–1999), after Asian carp establishment (2000–2009), and harvest (2010–2014) periods. Gizzard shad Wr and small gizzard shad CPUE decreased in the entire river after Asian carp invasion, and Wr and large gizzard shad CPUE rebounded where harvest occurred. Contrastingly, small gizzard CPUE has not yet exhibited a positive response to harvest. These mixed results indicate a time-lag may exist between management action and ecosystem response. Ultimately, Asian carp removal may be facilitating improvements in gizzard shad body condition (by increasing forage availability), which may portend a future gizzard shad population rebound.",no

We assessed the origin of 23 Bighead Carp and 1 Silver Carp captured from Chicago Urban Fishing Program ponds using otolith chemistry. Otolith core delta O-18 and delta C-13 of captured Bighead Carp did not overlap with ranges of otolith delta O-18 and delta C-13 from Bighead Carp and Silver Carp from the Illinois River but was consistent with otolith delta O-18 and delta C-13 of Bighead Carp obtained from aquaculture facilities. Likewise, otolith core Sr:Ca of 19 captured Bighead Carp was higher than the range of otolith Sr:Ca from Illinois River Bighead Carp and Silver Carp. Due to inferred timing of introduction (likely age-0 or age-1 fish), these Bighead Carp may have been released incidentally via stocking sport fish shipments contaminated with the carp. Contrastingly, otolith chemistry results suggest that the captured Silver Carp originated from the Illinois River, although timing of introduction of this fish could not be inferred. Overall, our results indicate that nearly all fish analyzed did not originate from rivers within the Mississippi River basin and were instead likely introduced through stocking contaminated shipments of fish. Even though Chicago Urban Fishing Program ponds now pose a minimal threat for Bighead Carp and Silver Carp expansion into Lake Michigan, sustained urban pond monitoring and nonnative fish removal may limit or eliminate this alternative invasion pathway. Additionally, continued vigilance in understanding the origin of stocked fish and culture environment (e.g., polyculture) could decrease the likelihood of future invasive species introductions through contaminated sport fish stockings.",no

Paleontological and molecular phylogenetic analyses demonstrate bighead and silver carps originated from the Yangtze‐Huanghe River basins and modern populations may have derived from the secondary contact of geographically isolated fish during the last glacial events. Significant genetic differences are found among populations of native rivers (Yangtze, Pearl, and Amur) as well as introduced/invasive environments (Mississippi R., USA and Danube R., Hungary), suggesting genetic backgrounds and ecological selection may play a role in population differentiation. Population divergence of bighead carp or silver carp has occurred within their native rivers, whereas, within the Mississippi River Basin (MRB)—an introduced region, such genetic differentiation is likely taking place at least in silver carp. Interspecific hybridization between silver and bighead carps is rare within their native regions; however, extensive hybridization is observed in the MRB, which could be contributed by a shift to a more homogenous environment that lacks reproductive isolation barriers for the restriction of gene flow between species. The wild populations of native bighead and silver carps have experienced dramatic declines; in contrast, the introduced bigheaded carps overpopulate the MRB and are considered two invasive species, which strongly suggests fishing capacity (overfishing and underfishing) be a decisive factor for fishery resource exploitation and management. This review provides not only a global perspective of evolutionary history and population divergence of bigheaded carps but also a forum that calls for international research collaborations to deal with critical issues related to native population conservation and invasive species control.",no

Juveniles were exposed to different concentrations of CAL solutions (0, 100, 300, 500 and 700 mg/L) for different immersion periods (12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hr). Increased glutamate‐oxaloacetate transaminase, glutamate‐pyruvate transaminase and alkaline phosphatases activities were assumed to be due to CAL‐induced hepatic damage, probably because of the high potential of CAL to accumulate in fish hepatopancreas. Higher CAL concentrations (>300 mg/L) and prolonged immersion periods (>48 hr) could lead to greater toxicity in juvenile silver carp and, to a certain degree, damage the gills and hepatopancreas. The antioxidant responses in the gills and hepatopancreas result in successful elimination of the excess CAL‐induced reactive oxygen species for CAL exposure ≤24 hr. Our results confirmed that the toxic effects of CAL on antioxidant enzyme levels and lipid peroxidation in juvenile silver carp depended on both CAL concentrations and duration of exposure. Moreover, concentration of CAL solutions and the immersion period should be, respectively, restricted to ≤300 mg/L and ≤24 hr, when CAL is used for immersion marking juvenile silver carp.",no

Three Mono Trap RCC18 adsorbents were used to extract samples. Volatile components were analyzed by gas phase-olfaction-mass spectrometry. The main odor-active substances were identified by aroma extraction dilution analysis. The overall odor profile was analyzed by electronic nose. Overall sensory evaluation showed that metallic and grassy in Chinese carp were heavier than those in American. Trimethylamine, ketones, aldehydes, and alcohols were the main odor components in the two species. Flavor dilution factors indicated that hexanal (grassy), 1-octen-3-ol (mushroom-like), and 2,3-pentanedione (milky) were important. Trimethylamine, 1-pentene-3-ol, 2,3-pentanedione, pentanal, 3-methyl-1-butanol, hexanal, 1-Hexanol, heptanal, 1-heptanol, 1-octen-3-ol, octanal, 2,3-pentanedione. D-limonene, nonanal, decanal, and naphthalene were the main flavor substances. The contents and intensities of volatile substances are generally higher in American than in Chinese silver carp. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The large numbers of American silver carp are problematic in the Great Lakes. Pollution of the water environment may cause contamination in the fish body and the smell of freshwater fish is heavy and unacceptable. This study focuses on the odor of American silver carp to provide a foundation for later deodorization to increase utilization of the American silver carp.",no

The fact that a species has not yet been assessed or is classified as Data Deficient does not imply that it is not under some level of risk.4 Among the major species produced in global aquaculture, some are Near Threatened, such as the silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), while others are listed in threatened categories, including the striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) and the Japanese sea cucumber (Apostichopus japonicus), both Endangered, and the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and the Chinese softshell turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis), both Vulnerable. [...]many important aquaculture species have not yet been evaluated, and these include: other major carps; salmonids; crustaceans such as whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei), giant tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon) and Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis); molluscs such as Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and Japanese carpet shells (Ruditapes philippinarum); and all the major farmed seaweeds. While aquaculture might not conserve the specific genetic identity of a certain wild stock in the way that a gene bank could (due, for example, to genetic drift or deliberate selection), it is likely that the genes from the source population are retained within the farmed resource overall and thus are not completely lost to aquaculture if the original wild source population is compromised or goes extinct.",no

In this study, the transferrin gene (LwTf) from Amur ide (Leuciscus waleckii) was cloned and characterized. The cDNA was observed to contain an open reading frame (ORF) of 1998bp and encode a 665-amino-acid-long protein that shares 73.04% identity with the transferrin from silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). Amino acid alignment analysis showed that LwTf contained an initial peptide and two lobes (N- and C-lobes). Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses showed that the expression levels of LwTf were abundant in the liver of the fish but were also significant in the brain and spleen, with lower expression observed in six other tissues. The temporal expression profiles were detected during the alkaline challenge experiment in alkali-water and freshwater populations of healthy adult Amur ide. LwTf expression was significantly upregulated in the main immune organs (spleen, kidney, and head kidney) of the freshwater Amur ide population compared to that in the alkali-water Amur ide population. Taken together, these results indicate that in Amur ide, LwTf might play an important role in the innate immune response to a high alkaline stress.",no

As a typical river-lake migratory fish species, the silver carp habitat selection was determined by its migration preference and genetic features. In this study, 15 microsatellite fluorescent markers combined with capillary electrophoresis were used to analyze the genetic diversity, genetic differentiation, and structure of nature silver carp populations in the Sanzhou (SZ), Hukou (HK), Anqing (AQ), Zhenjiang (ZJ), and Rugao (RG) sections of the Yangtze River. The results showed that 15 microsatellite loci exhibited medium to high polymorphisms. The overall genetic diversity in the Yangtze River was high, with the average value of Shannon's information index ranging from 1.559 to 1.668. The numbers of alleles (Ne) ranged from 1.630 to 10.100. The expected heterozygosity (He, 0.690-0.721) was higher than observed heterozygosity (Ho, 0.598-0.646), and the genetic variation mainly originated from within the population (94.69%). However, the entire population was in the state of heterozygous deletion, and HK, RG populations encountered the risk of inbreeding risk (F > 1). Interestingly, there was a distinct genetic structure for the population in the HK section, which indicated that local population has occurred to the silver carp in this river section, and they may also possess aggregation characteristics specific to the river-lake-connected (RLC) habitat. The results mostly support the conclusion that the RLC habitat is essential for geographic population formation. The potential impact of special habitats on natural populations should be considered, and continuous surveys on population dynamics should be performed.",no

Efforts to control the spread of these invasive species require information on their spatial ecology, though sampling is hindered by their broad extent, habitat tolerances, and species‐specific behaviour. Mobile hydroacoustics was used to quantify habitat and depth use of bigheaded carp over four years in the heavily invaded Lower Illinois River, a major Mississippi tributary and potential dispersal pathway to the Great Lakes. Horizontally oriented transducers (combined with capture gear for species designation) enabled sampling of the main habitat features in this large flood plain river. Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) were dominant over bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) at all but one site, although habitat use was similar for both species. Densities were highest in lotic backwaters, followed by lentic backwaters and nearshore main channel, with lowest densities in the mid main channel. Bigheaded carp size and species composition were independent of habitat type. Depth associations were similar for both species, with average occurrence at 2.5–3.5 m in the main channel and 1–2 m in backwaters. However, depth relative to the river bed was largely similar across habitat types. Bigheaded carp density and depth use in the main channel were linked non‐linearly to river discharge and water temperature, respectively; densities were reduced during high discharge, whereas depth use became shallower at higher temperatures. Density–hydrology trends were less apparent in backwaters. These findings highlight critical aspects of bigheaded carp spatial ecology that will facilitate effective management in invaded and at‐risk ecosystems.",no

The climate changes observed in the world over the past several decades strongly affect global aquaculture and fisheries. Ukraine is among the 24 countries, whose aquaculture and inland fisheries are currently facing medium stress, and will be potentially under higher stress in the future. The purpose of our work was to find a relation between air temperature and its impact on the spreading of infectious in freshwater aquaculture of Ukraine in the context of global climate change. Material and methods. During 2011-2017, an epizootiological survey on experimental fishery farms of different patterns of ownership was conducted. The objects of research were the clinically healthy and diseased freshwater fish of different age groups, as well as parasites and bacteria of different etiological groups that affect aquatic organisms. A review of the clinical and parasitological study of different age groups and hybrids of silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Valenciennes, 1844) and bighead carp, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis (Richardson, 1845), common carp, Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758, and some cultured rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum, 1792), and brown trout, Salmo trutta Linnaeus, 1758 were conducted. Research methods common for ichthyopathology, microbiology, and fisheries were used. Results. The study on fish diseases was conducted both in aquaculture and natural waters, in particular in the reservoirs of the Dnieper Cascade. Not only the growth and development of fish but also the signs and the course of various diseases appeared to depend on water temperature. The resistance of the fish and other hydrobionts to the influence of threshold temperatures depends on their adaptation to particular factors. In the years with a relatively warm vegetation period, the infection rates significantly increased to 25% and above. A significant broadening of the spectrum of parasitic infections over the last decade has been noted. An ecological misbalance in the ecosystems, an increase in the level of organic pollution of water, and, as a result, in the number of pathogenic microorganisms that may be harmful to fish and human health were registered. Conclusion. Taking into account the results of the analytical studies regarding climate change in Ukraine, we can predict outbreaks of bacterial and parasitic diseases in fish in the years to come, which may cause significant economic damage to aquaculture farms.",no

Ingestion is a vital pathway for PFASs to transmit to humans especially through water and fish. In present study, PFASs in water and fish from the drinking water source of Beijing in China were investigated. Three layers of water were collected in order to find the connection between concentrations of PFASs and depth of water, which showed no prominent correlation. PFASs in water from Miyun Reservoir with concentrations of 5.30-8.50 ng/L, were relatively lower compared with other reports on raw drinking water. Perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were the dominant PFASs. In addition, six species of fish (including Cyprinus carpio, Carassius auratus, Erythroculter dabryi, Pseudohemiculter dispar, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Siniperca chuatsi) were analyzed, with concentrations of PFASs ranging from 1.70 to 14.32 ng/g wet weight (w.w.). Due to relatively stronger bioaccumulation potential, long chain perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs) and perfluorinated sulfonates (PFSAs) were detected with higher concentrations, especially perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUdA) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA). The estimated daily intake (EDI) of PFASs through drinking water and fish consumption were 0.20-0.34 and 3.44-12.61 ng/kg bw/day based on Exposure Factors Handbook of Chinese Population, respectively.

The presence of these alien species and their hybrids in Hungarian natural water bodies may pose significant ecological risks (connected with their phytoplankton and zooplankton consumption). To be able to deal with the ecological risks and to understand the potential of invasiveness of these species, one must have information on the population-level genetic structures of these alien fish stocks. Ten microsatellite DNA markers and one mitochondrial marker were used to address these questions. The results showed that the two stocks are genetically different; the lake population was genetically more diverse and consisted of hybrid and silver carp individuals, while the river population contained only silver carps. The mitochondrial sequences found in the two populations originated from the Yangtze River. Based on the different genetic structures of the stocks, one can assume that bigheaded carps do not reproduce in Lake Balaton, while the Tisza River stock represents significant reproductive potential and may become invasive in this river. Bigheaded carps (bighead carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, and silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and their hybrids play an important ecological and economic role in their original habitat, while their introduced stocks may pose serious ecological risks. To address questions about the persistence and invasiveness of these fish, we need to better understand their population structures. The genetic structures of bigheaded carp populations inhabiting Lake Balaton and the Tisza River were examined with ten microsatellite markers and a mitochondrial DNA marker (COI). The Lake Balaton stock showed higher genetic diversity compared with the Tisza River stock. Based on hierarchical clustering, the Tisza population was characterized only by only silver carps, while the Balaton stock included hybrid and silver carp individuals. All COI haplotypes originated from the Yangtze River. Based on the high genomic and mitochondrial diversity, along with the significant deviation from H-W equilibrium and the lack of evidence of bottleneck effect, it can be assumed that bigheaded carps do not reproduce in Lake Balaton. The present stock in Balaton may have originated from repeated introductions and escapes from the surrounding fishponds. The Tisza stock consists solely of silver carp individuals. This stock appears to have significant reproductive potential and may become invasive if environmental factors change due to climate change.",no
"Morgan, M., and Y. Ho",2018,Perception of Asian carp as a possible food source among missouri anglers,Human Dimensions of Wildlife,23,5,491-498,"Silver and bighead carps were imported from China to the United States in the 1970s as a biological control mechanism for improving water quality. After escaping captivity, both species spread into the Mississippi River Basin and now threaten to enter the Great Lakes. Human consumption is one solution, but many Americans believe that carp is unsavory. A random sample of 2,000 licensed anglers in Missouri was asked to complete a mail-back questionnaire about Asian carp, yielding a 27% response rate (n = 465). Results indicated that knowledge and perception about carp were poor, and food neophobia (fear of new foods) scores were above average. Less than 15% of respondents had eaten carp, but nearly 53% were willing to try. Marketing should focus on the benefits of consumption while downplaying any possible concerns. Although education programs are worthwhile, taste might be more influential to change public attitudes toward Asian carp.",no

Exploiting the chance provided by the specific hybrid bigheaded carp stock in Lake Balaton (Hungary) covering the entire morphological range between the two species (including gill raker morphology), we implemented a comprehensive study (1) to reveal the feeding habits of hybrid bigheaded carps living in a mesotrophic, lacustrine habitat and (2) to assess how biotic and abiotic environmental factors and gill raker morphology affect diet composition. We found that all bigheaded carps utilized primarily zooplankton and neglected the scarce and inefficiently digestible phytoplankton, irrespective of gill raker morphology. Moreover, we observed strikingly high levels of inorganic debris consumption, but the proportion of inorganic matter in the guts was not associated directly with the concentration of suspended inorganic particles. Variance in the diet composition of bigheaded carps was related mostly to environmental factors, including the wind-induced resuspension of inorganic particles and seasonally variable availability of food resources. In conclusion, the effects of abiotic environmental factors and available food resources could overwhelm the effect of gill raker morphology in shaping the feeding habits of bigheaded carps.",no

A pond (10 m × 5 m × 1.2 m) was divided in half by a concrete‐block barrier with a channel (1 m across) allowing fish access to each side. Underwater speakers were placed on each side of the barrier opening, and an outboard motor noise (broadband sound; 0.06–10 kHz) was broadcast to repel carp that approached within 1 m of the channel. Broadband sound was effective at reducing the number of successful crossings in schools of silver carp, bighead carp and a combined school. Repulsion rates were 82.5% (silver carp), 93.7% (bighead carp) and 90.5% (combined). This study demonstrates that broadband sound is effective in deterring carp and could be used as a deterrent in an integrated pest management system.",no

However. there is concern that acoustic deterrents may impact the movement of non-target native fishes in the Upper Mississippi River. We evaluated the potential impacts of a broadband underwater acoustic deterrent on native ostariophysans [bigmouth buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas)], invasive ostariophysans [bighead carp, common carp (Cyprinus carpio), grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) and silver carp], and native non-ostariophysans [(American eel (Anguilla rostrata), gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), hybrid striped bass (M. saxatilis x M. chrysops), lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) and paddlefish (Polyodon spathula)]. Fish were exposed to playback of the broadband sound (60-10000 Hz), and their behavior was evaluated. Bighead carp showed a strong negative phonotaxis response to the stimulus [12.3 +/- 7.5 (SD) mean consecutive reactions]. silver carp and grass carp showed moderate responses (4.5 +/- 5.2 and 3.8 +/- 3.5 reactions), and common carp displayed low responses (1.3 +/- 1.9 reactions). Of the native fish bigmouth buffalo (2.1 +/- 2.9 reactions) and hybrid striped bass (0.3 +/- 0.5 reactions) were the only species to demonstrate observable response to the acoustic stimulus. Based on this small-scale behavioral screening, acoustic deterrents should have minimal impact on native species, however, larger pond and field trials are necessary to confirm this finding.",no

Methods: Silver carp meat batters were prepared with 0.5, 1 (reduced-salt) and 2 % (regular salt), and sonicated (20 KHz, 500 W) for 30 and 40 min, or unsonicated (control). Changes in gel properties were evaluated in terms of color, texture, cooking loss and microstructure using color measurement, puncture test, cooking loss and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis, respectively. Results: Ultrasound and salt exposure led to marked effects on color, texture and cooking loss in fish meat gels (p < 0.05). Reduction in salt content increased the lightness (L*) and cooking loss; and also decreased the sample values of greenness (-a*), breaking force, rupture distance and gel strength. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on regular-salt level samples showed that ultrasonic exposure decreased dense aggregates and increased the number and distribution of small cavity samples. Reduced-salt samples (1 % salt) subjected to 30 min sonication had better color (lighter) than control (0 min sonication), better texture (higher gel strength) and cooking loss comparable to that of regular-salt level sample subjected to 30 min sonication, and similar to microstructures from normal salt samples without ultrasound exposure. Conclusion: Low frequency ultrasound is suitable for preparing reduced-salt fish meat gels under suitable ultrasonic conditions.",no

It was found that the relationships among growth parameters of metals mixture stressed as well as unstressed (control) fish were significantly different. Results showed that, the sub-lethal exposure of metals mixture induced substantial impacts on the wet weight gain (g) and length (mm) of fish species, with following trend; C. catla> C. idella> C. mrigala> L. rohita >H. molitrix. However, growth rate of fish under control treatment (no stress) was significantly higher compared to the fish exposed to metals mixture. It was also observed that the condition factor was positively correlated with fish growth and expressed the extent of fish well-beings.

Recent behavioral studies indicate bigheaded carps are deterred by acoustic barriers and exhibit negative phonotaxis in response to anthropogenic sound sources (≥ 150 dB re 1 μPa). However, the impact of long-term exposure to these sounds on the hearing capabilities of bigheaded carps has not been well documented. In this study, the auditory evoked potential (AEP) technique was used to determine auditory thresholds among bigheaded carps before and after exposure to high intensity (155.7 ± 4.7 dB re 1 μPa SPLrms; − 8.0 ± 4.7 dB re 1 ms−2 PALrms; mean ± SD) broadband sound. Fish were exposed to sound for 30 min or 24 h and AEP measurements were taken at three time points: immediately after exposure, 48 h, or 96 h later. Results indicate that silver and bighead carp experience temporary threshold shifts (TTSs) in frequency detection following sound exposure with the magnitude and length of TTS correlated with exposure duration.

Additionally, new results show that the CPUE and biomass of Bigmouth Buffalo were more inversely related to Silver Carp CPUE and biomass relative to the CPUE and biomass of Gizzard Shad. These results reinforce that Silver Carp likely suppress native planktivores and also suggest that diet and other life-history traits may explain some of the subtle differences in species-specific responses.

Particularly interesting is fish skin collagen, which is relatively easy to extract comparing mammalian tissues and free of some pathogens that are dangerous to humans. The paper presents results of IR Raman spectroscopy studies of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) skin collagen. As collagen properties result from its structure and conformation, both sensitive to temperature, FT NIR Raman spectroscopy is an excellent tool to characterize the molecular structure of fish skin collagen, particularly in temperature range typical for the manufacturing processes of biomedical products. Therefore, the Raman spectra were recorded in a temperature range of 300 to 403 K. The analysis of Raman spectra of prepared collagen films, particularly in the range of the bands related to amide I and amide III entities, showed a high content of α-helix and α-helix type molecular organization in fish skin collagen. Additionally, the secondary structure of the studied fish skin collagen is stable up to ~358 K. Heating to 403 K leads to irreversible changes in the molecular structure of fish skin collagen. It was found that the Raman spectrum of fish skin collagen preheated in this manner becomes similar to the spectrum of the collagen obtained from bovine Achilles tendon, whose secondary structure does not change up to 403 K.",no

Little is known about the assimilation of natural food resources into fish. In order to elucidate the food web and nitrogen flows in a traditionally and a semi-intensively managed pond in Vietnam, delta super(13)C and delta super(15)N in pond inputs and fish were measured before and after the application of inorganic super(15)N at 1.1 and 0.4 % of total nitrogen. The applied super(15)N was traced through the biomass of stocked fish over 30 days. Under traditional management, grass carp was the dominant species in number and biomass. After 30 days, grass carp assimilated 1.2 % of the applied tracer through natural food resources. Filter feeders assimilated only 0.1-0.3 % of the tracer after 30 days because of the limited productivity in the traditionally managed pond. Nile tilapia showed the highest uptake rates over the 30 days, which demonstrated their ability to feed on a variety of natural food resources.

Grass carp was stocked at lower density, but had the highest biomass by the time of the experiment. Grass carp assimilated 0.2 % of the applied tracer suggesting a low contribution of natural food resources to its nutrition. Silver carp benefited most from the higher natural food resources. In total, 4.1 % of applied super(15)N was assimilated into fish biomass after 30 days. Traditional small-scale aquaculture of a grass carp-dominated polyculture has a lower assimilation efficiency of applied fertilizers into fish biomass than a common carp-dominated polyculture under semi-intensive management.",no

Amberg",2017,Using silver and bighead carp cell lines for the identification of a unique metabolite fingerprint from thiram-specific chemical exposure,Chemosphere,168,,1477-1485,"Conservation biology often requires the control of invasive species. One method is the development and use of biocides. Identifying new chemicals as part of the biocide registration approval process can require screening millions of compounds. Traditionally, screening new chemicals has been done in vivo using test. organisms. Using in vitro (e.g., cell lines) and in silico (e.g., computer models) methods decrease test organism requirements and increase screening speed and efficiency. These methods, however, would be greatly improved by better understanding how individual fish species metabolize selected compounds. We combined cell assays and metabolomics to create a powerful tool to facilitate the identification of new control chemicals. Specifically, we exposed cell lines established from bighead carp and silver carp larvae to thiram (7 concentrations) then completed metabolite profiling to assess the dose-response of the bighead carp and silver carp metabolome to thiram. Forty one of the 700 metabolomic markers identified in bighead carp exhibited a dose-response to thiram exposure compared to silver carp in which 205 of 1590 metabolomic markers exhibited a dose-response. Additionally, we identified 11 statistically significant metabolomic markers based upon volcano plot analysis common between both species. This smaller subset of metabolites formed a thiram-specific metabolomic fingerprint which allowed for the creation of a toxicant specific, rather than a species-specific, metabolomic fingerprint. Metabolomic fingerprints may be used in biocide development and improve our understanding of ecologically significant events, such as mass fish kills. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",no

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the suitability of cryopreservation protocols and the effectiveness of ultrasound for silver carp embryos. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Embryos at three developmental stages were exposed to 10, 15, 20, and 25% of five cryoprotectants (CPAs), namely propylene glycol (PG), dimethylformamide (DFA), DMSO, Me0H, and ethylene glycol (EG) for 20 min. Embryos were exposed to twelve vitrification solutions (VSs) for 10 (five steps of 2 min), 15 (five steps of 3 min), 20 (five steps of 4 min) min. Embryos were also exposed to ultrasound in VSs prior to cooling for cryopreservation. RESULTS: Hatching rates decreased with increasing CPA concentrations while toxicity varied in the order of PG < DMSO < EG < MeOH < DFA. Tail elongation stage was more tolerant to CPA than 6-somites and morula stages. The survival of embryos exposed to ultrasound in VS was remarkably lower than in water. Embryos exposed to ultrasound in VSs under the best conditions did not response well after attempted vitrification. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-mediated CPA impregnation could be effective but other innovative methods may be needed to attain successful cryopreservation.",no

The results showed that the dried fish produced by the solar tunnel drying method were rehydrated more rapidly than the products produced by the traditional and improved drying methods. The moisture content of the dried H. molitrix was varied from 18.24 to 25.43% on a fresh matter basis. There was no significant (p > 0.05) difference found regarding the protein, lipid, and ash content among the different drying methods on a dry matter basis. The total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N) contents ranged between 37.58 and 45.03 mg/100 g, and significantly (p < 0.05) the lowest TVB-N was observed in dried fish produced by the solar tunnel drying method. Moreover, the highest peroxide and acid values were found in the traditionally produced dried fish as compared with the fish dried by the improved and solar tunnel drying methods. The aerobic plate count of dried fish ranged from 4.52 to 7.51 log CFU/g.

Water guns were deployed in a channel that connects the Illinois River to backwater quarry pits that contained a large transient population of bigheaded carp. To evaluate the effect of water guns, mobile side-looking split-beam hydroacoustic surveys were conducted before, during and between replicated water gun firing periods. Water guns did not affect abundance of bigheaded carp, but abundance of native fish detected during the firing treatment was 43 and 34% lower than the control and water guns off treatments, respectively. The proximity of bigheaded carp to the water gun array was similar between the water guns on and water guns off treatments. In contrast, the closest detected native fish were detected farther from the water guns during the water guns on treatment (mean +/- SE, 32.38 +/- 3.32 m) than during the water guns off treatment (15.04 +/- 1.59 m). The water gun array had a greater impact on native fish species than on bigheaded carp.

Increasing evidence suggests harmful impacts of BHC on native fisheries (e.g., competition). Monitoring the abundance of BHC is difficult with traditional fisheries gears, and few studies have evaluated early life stage sampling. Identifying the spawning locations of BHC through early life stage sampling has the ability to enhance management efforts by applying focus to areas that have potential to serve as population sources. We evaluated the performance of three gears in sampling larval BHC and native taxa within large‐river tributaries in terms of abundance, community assemblage, and size structure. We sampled ichthyoplankton in tributaries with active (push net) and passive (drift net, light trap) gears from March through September 2016. Relative abundance of BHC was greatest in push nets followed by drift nets and was lowest in light traps. Native cyprinids and catostomids as well as BHC comprised a large portion of the total catch. Environmental and habitat characteristics (stream velocity, dissolved oxygen, and temperature) related to BHC reproduction influenced each gear’s ability to capture larval BHC, although relationships in final models were not significant. Taxonomic size selectivity existed among gears; in particular, larger BHC were collected in push nets relative to the other gears. Push nets were the most effective in sampling BHC, and remaining gears exhibited unique strengths. Although less effective than active push nets, drift nets proved useful for monitoring BHC in tributaries and may be advantageous in shallow systems with adequate flow. Light traps were ineffective at capturing BHC larvae in tributaries but may offer utility in lentic habitats or for native cyprinids. Our comparison serves as a guide for monitoring larval BHC in their invaded range and for detection in new areas, such as tributaries of the Great Lakes.",no

We simulated BHC population growth and food web effects under different scenarios of BHC production rates, prey vulnerability to BHCs, and availability of age-0 BHCs to predation by salmonines. In the main basins of Lakes Michigan and Huron, the projected BHC population growth was low or negative, with a projected final BHC biomass of 0.5-1.1 times the initial introductory biomass (2% of total fish biomass for each BHC species), and BHCs had negligible effects on most food web groups across all scenarios. In contrast, in Saginaw Bay and Lake Erie, the projected BHC biomass was 2.5-12.5 times higher than the initial biomass across all scenarios, and the largest increases occurred under scenarios of high prey vulnerability to BHCs and high BHC production rates. High projected BHC biomass in Saginaw Bay and Lake Erie had negative effects on zooplankton and planktivorous fish groups and mixed effects on piscivores but had relatively negligible effects on most other food web groups across all scenarios.

Selectivity was measured over 24 h in 2-m-diameter pools containing one of two prey assemblages consisting of three individuals from each of three species: (1) Bighead Carp with native littoral (Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus) and pelagic prey (Golden Shiner Notemigonus crysoleucas) or (2) Bighead Carp, Silver Carp, and a morphologically similar native prey (Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum). Foraging efficiency and predator-prey behaviors were quantified in 45-min trials in which Largemouth Bass foraged on 10 individuals of a single prey species inside a 750-L observation tank. All prey species were readily attacked and consumed by Largemouth Bass; Silver Carp were selected less often than Gizzard Shad, and Bighead Carp were selected at a higher rate than any of the other prey species. Of the species tested, Bighead Carp formed the tightest schools and were captured most efficiently by Largemouth Bass.

Abiotic data were analyzed from individual study tributaries and were pooled among tributaries with substantial versus minimal evidence of bigheaded carp reproduction. In total, 5,689 larval bigheaded carp were captured during three sampling seasons. Of the six study tributaries, we captured the most bigheaded carp larvae in the Sangamon River, followed by the Little Wabash, Embarras, Spoon, Mackinaw, and Vermilion rivers. Based on previous literature, we investigated differences in watershed area, discharge, water temperature, turbidity, and free-flowing stretches of river in our study tributaries. In general, tributaries with greater relative abundances of bigheaded carp eggs and larvae had larger watersheds, greater discharge, lower Secchi depths (higher turbidity), and longer free-flowing stretches than those with minimal evidence of reproduction.

An annular swim flume was used to measure U-burst and sprint duration of the model species largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) across a range of pCO(2) levels (<400atm [ambient]; 10,000atm; 50,000atm; and 100,000atm). This species was tested as a proxy because of the likelihood of a similar CO2 response being produced, as well as constraints in obtaining and housing appropriately sized Asian carp. A significant decrease in U-burst swimming occurred when exposed to 100,000atm. No effects on sprint duration were detected. In both swimming tests, 15% of fish lost equilibrium when exposed to 50,000atm pCO(2), while 50% of fish lost equilibrium when exposed to 100,000atm.

To date, conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been one of the most widely used assays in field studies to detect eDNA. This assay is strictly a test for the presence of the genetic marker. It provides no estimate of the concentration of the target genetic marker in the sample or in the environment. Understanding the concentration of a target marker in the environment is a critical first step toward using the results of eDNA field surveys to support inferences about the location and strength of eDNA sources. In this study, the results of eDNA field surveys are combined with a model of the sensitivity of the field survey methods to estimate target marker concentrations using Bayesian updating. The method is demonstrated for Asian carp in the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) using the results of field surveys for eDNA carried out during the period 2009 through 2012, a four-year period during which more than 5,800 two-liter water samples were collected and analyzed using PCR. Concentrations of bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) eDNA are estimated for twenty hydrologic reaches of the CAWS. This study also assesses the sensitivity of these concentration estimates to evidentiary criteria that limit what evidence is used in Bayesian updating based on requirements for sampling intensity and frequency.",no

The results showed that the polymorphic information content (PIC) of these fourteen loci was between 0.306-0.848, 9 of 14 loci were highly polymorphic (PIC > 0.5). The allele number (Na) of the 6 populations was between 5-18, and the effective allele number (Ne) ranged from 1.5628 to 7.2676. The observed heterozygosity and expected heterozygosity were ranged from 0.287 to 0.753, and from 0.361 to 0.865, respectively. The average polymorphism information content was between 0.306 to 0.848. The Jianli, Changsha and Jiaxing population showed relatively high genetic diversity in all six populations(PIC > 0.5). The genetic distance between the Jianli and Hanjiang was the highest, while Ruichang and Jiaxing with the lowest genetic distance. The phylogenetic relation results showed the six populations were clustered into two clades, which indicated that there were differentiated in certain degree among the middle and lower populations in Yangtze river basin and the populations of this research may belong to different spawning grounds.

Experiments were conducted in batch process, and a number of influencing parameters, such as solution pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time, and initial Congo red concentration, were thoroughly investigated for optimization. Kinetic and equilibrium data were well described by pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir isotherm, respectively. Suitability of pseudo-second-order model to best fit with the adsorption process was corroborated by squared sum of errors analysis. Mass transfer mechanism was confirmed by intraparticle pore diffusion and Bangham’s diffusion models. Maximum sorption capacity of fish bone powder was found to be 666.67 mg·g−1. The optimum condition (adsorbent dose: 5 g·L−1; pH: 2.0; operating time: 4 h) for maximum sorption was determined as well. The increasing negative value of Gibbs free energy (ΔG) with temperature rise indicated spontaneous nature and feasibility of adsorption. The positive values of ΔH and ΔS suggested that the adsorption reaction is endothermic and random (at the solid/liquid interface) in nature. The activation energy (29.84 kJ·mol−1) indicated that the sorption process was of physisorption type. A considerably high adsorption capacity pointed towards utilization of this apparently useless biomaterial as an effective adsorbent.",no

This study determined the effects of current sluice management on the fish community in the Baral River, a major connection to the largest wetland (Chalan Beel) in Bangladesh. It also examines wider problems for biodiversity conservation (particularly waterbirds) in that wetland, which has shrunk to 30% of its former dry‐season size in 50 years. During the flood period, the peak breeding time for native floodplain fishes, sluices were in undershot operation (open by 16–60% of water depth). During this time, fish abundance and species richness were 229% and 155% higher respectively at sites upstream of the sluices, despite similar habitat upstream and downstream. Outside this period, when sluices were fully open, abundance and species richness were similar upstream and downstream. Fish samples were dominated by fry, which are susceptible to damage by sluices. Twenty (41.7%) of 48 fish species captured in this study are classed as threatened in Bangladesh and their abundance was significantly lower downstream of the sluices. Two alien species, Aristichthys nobilis and Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, were recorded, probably escapees from local aquaculture activities. Twenty‐five species of wetland birds were recorded in the Chalan Beel. From interviews, 64% of these species appear to have decreased in the last 20 years, together with 11 more species that may have become locally extinct over this period. This suggests that widespread ecological disruption is occurring. Improved water management (e.g. gate opening height and duration) or modification (e.g. fish pass) of the Baral sluices is needed, to meet biodiversity and fisheries needs, rather than just for flood control and crop production. Improved hydrological and ecological connectivity and habitat protection are needed, as are a cessation of destructive fishing and seasonal fish ranching practices that currently provide synergistic pressures.",no

We used automatic methods, which acquire fish swimming tracks using computer vision (video). We examined the flow field using hydrodynamic software simulation; then, using the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm, each frame of the flow field was divided into areas of different velocity. Finally, the automatic fish trajectory tracking was coupled with hydraulic simulation of the flow field to compute an estimate of the time fish spent in each velocity area. To validate results from the automatic method, we used manual examination of videos of swimming juvenile silver carp to analyse their preferred velocity fields.

We have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the ecological status of water bodies in Central Polissya, using current and retrospective data of hydrochemical, hydrobiological analysis for rivers described in this article. The article presents the results of the ecological assessment of surface water quality of rivers Uzh and Irsha, taking into account hydrochemical parameters that indicate the polluted state (class III) during 2018-2020 with a significant contribution and in the formation of the quality class of salt composition, trophosaprobiological block, and block of other toxic substances. Flushing from urban areas contributes a significant share to the pollution of Polissya's surface springs. An essential component of bioresources is fish stocks, which have been declining in recent years. The main factors hindering the development of fisheries and negatively affecting the reproduction of fish stocks are pollution of water bodies, violation of the hydrological regime, weakening of state control over the catch and sale of aquatic living resources. Analysis of the age composition of the ichthyofauna of the studied rivers by catching nets and tools for catching young fish makes it possible to determine perch (Perca fluviatilis) and silver carp (Carassius gibelio) dominate in the reservoirs.

Collagen solutions were irradiated with UV light (wavelength 254 nm) for up to 2 h and rheological properties were measured. All the collagen solutions showed a shear-thinning flow behavior. A constant viscosity region was observed after 1 h of UV irradiation, which showed that collagen molecules were fully denatured. A short treatment with collagen solution by UV (ultraviolet) light led to an increase in viscosity; however, the denaturation temperature of UV-irradiated collagen decreased. Depending on the time of UV treatment, collagen extracted from Silver Carp fish skin may undergo physical crosslinking or photodegradation. Physically crosslinked collagen may find applications in functional food, cosmetic, biomedical, and pharmaceutical industries.",no

It now has reached the threshold of the Laurentian Great Lakes, where it likely will significantly impact food chains and fisheries. Our study evaluates population genetic variability and differentiation of the silver carp using 10 nuclear DNA microsatellite loci, and sequences of two mitochondrial genes–cytochrome b and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, along with the nuclear ribosomal protein S7 gene intron 1. We analyze population samples from: two primary Great Lakes’ invasion fronts (at the Illinois River outside of Chicago, IL in Lake Michigan and in the Wabash River, which leads into the Maumee River and western Lake Erie), the original establishment “core” in the Lower Mississippi River, and expansion areas in the Upper Mississippi and Missouri rivers. We analyze and compare our results with bighead and other invasive carps, and cyprinid relatives. Results reveal that the silver carp invasion possesses moderate levels of genetic diversity, with more mtDNA haplotypes and unique microsatellite alleles in the “core” Lower Mississippi River population, which also diverges the most. The two invasion fronts also significantly genetically differ. About 3% of individuals (including all populations except the Illinois River) contain a unique and very divergent mtDNA haplotype, which likely stems from historic introgression in Asia with female largescale silver carp H. harmandi. The nuclear microsatellites and S7 sequences of the introgressed individuals do not differ from silver carp and are very distant from bighead carp. These sequence variation data are employed to design and evaluate a targeted high-throughput metabarcoding sequence assay that identifies and distinguishes among species of invasive carps (i.e., silver, bighead, grass, black, and common carps, along with goldfish), as well as native cyprinids, using cytochrome b. Our assay further differentiates among selected silver carp haplotypes (including between H. molitrix and H. harmandi), for use in population genetics and future analyses of spread pathways. We test and evaluate this assay on environmental (e)DNA water samples from 48 bait shops in the Great Lakes’ region (along the Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair, and Wabash River watersheds), using positive and negative controls and custom bioinformatic processing. Test results discern silver carp eDNA in four of the shops–three in Lake Erie and one in the Wabash River watershed–and bighead carp from one of the same Lake Erie venues, suggesting that retailers (who often source from established southerly populations) comprise another introduction vector.

Predicting population collapse and understanding the self-reinforced feedback mechanisms that erode the resilience of native species are two major challenges in invasion ecology. However, to date, empirical evidence of species invasion-induced regime shifts remains scarce, and the minimum required data to generate early warning signals (EWSs) before critical transitions remains unclear, despite its importance for ecosystem management. By combining 80-year (i.e., 1936–2016) fishery data from Lake Qiandao and a theoretical competition model, we provide evidence that relative to nutrient enrichment and climate change, stocking alien fish species of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Aristichthys nobtilis) is the most important driver leading to the collapse of local fish populations. Detectable EWSs indicated by the variance, autocorrelation and composite resilience indicators require at least ten years of data before an abrupt decline, demonstrating that a long-term ecological monitoring program is necessary for providing insight into resilience dynamics. A structural equation model (SEM) suggests that the combined effects of eutrophication, high water levels and carp stocking-induced water clarity decline may play an important role in the reduced fitness of local fish populations, which subsequently increase the carrying capacity of alien fish populations. Our results demonstrate that stocking alien carps result in competitive exclusion of local fish populations, especially in the current context of water eutrophication and global climate changes. Furthermore, quantifying the minimum required time series length with detectable EWS across various ecosystems should be further studied given that this information is critical for flexible management policies to take actions to avert the harmful transitions.",no

Biodiversity would apparently seem to be most unambiguous and easily studied of ecological concepts. Biodiversity refers to the variety and variability among organisms and ecosystem complexes in which they occur. It includes diversity of forms right from the molecular unit to the individual organisms and then to the populations, communities, ecosystem, landscapes and biosphere. The ichthyofaunal studies concentrates primarily on fish diversity and related indices. The main problem in developing the fisheries of reservoirs has been, inadequate stocking of advanced fingerlings, stocking of small sized fingerlings, skewed proportion of stocked fingerlings and inappropriate release of fingerlings at a specific place and time. Tilapia, African catfish and Red bellied fish (Pacchu / Pagu) has become a dominant species with landings comprising small-sized fishes in many of the small and big reservoirs. The love among the people for the exotics has found another niche and reservoirs are being stocked with silver carp, grass carp and common carp to the detriment of indigenous fauna. It is time that fast growing local species with a consumer preference and high economic value are stocked with efforts to produce their seed close to the reservoir concerned. Owing to these variables, the present review work has been planned with ichthyofaunal studies and outlined on fish diversity, aquaculture fish production, native fish fauna identification, breeding and development of seed production techniques, threats and conservation of reservoir fisheries.

Induced breeding of these species enlarged the geographical range for their culture as well as permitted more reliable seed supply. For the assessment of efficiency, long-term data from 18 spawning seasons on induced breeding of Chinese carps at a large-scale hatchery were evaluated. Assessment of ovulation was carried out by determining the ovulation ratio (number of ovulated females / number of injected females) x 100. The relative amount of stripped eggs (pseudo-gonadosomatic index, PGSI) was calculated as follows: (weight of stripped egg mass / body weight before stripping) x 100. We also analyzed the ovulation ratio and the PGSI relative to three different weight classes of females (small, medium and large). Over the 18 spawning seasons, 555 silver carp, 300 bighead carp and 1175 grass carp females were selected for propagation. Almost 80% of silver carp females selected belonged to categories between 4 and 7 kg. For grass carp and especially for bighead carp, breeders preferred higher weight categories. Ovulation ratios were similar between silver carp (80.9%), bighead carp (77.3%) and grass carp (79.1%). Mean PGSI for grass carp (9.3 +/- 4.26%) was significantly lower than that for silver carp (10.5 +/- 4.85%) and bighead carp (10.1 +/- 3.96).

One deterrent strategy that shows promise is elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in water which can alter the behavior of freshwater fishes, including invasive bigheaded carps (Hypophthalmichthys spp.). However, few studies have evaluated behavioral responses to elevated CO2 concentrations at different water temperatures. The objective of this study was to quantify CO2 concentrations needed to achieve avoidance (voluntary response) and narcosis (involuntary response observed by loss of equilibrium) behaviors in silver carp (H. molitrix) and bighead carp (H. nobilis) at 5, 15, and 25 degrees C. Overall, silver carp and bighead carp displayed avoidance and narcosis behaviors to CO2 at each water temperature, however bighead carp responded at higher CO2 concentrations than silver carp. Behavioral avoidance and narcosis were observed at approximately 40% lower CO2 concentrations in 5 degrees C water relative to 25 degrees C suggesting considerable influence of water temperature on a CO2 stimulus for both species. Results indicate that fluctuating water temperature (e.g., spatial and temporal variation across management sites) can influence how fish respond to elevated CO2, and may usefully be considered when applying CO2 as a behavioral deterrent.",no

Although habitat fragmentation may be detrimental to native fish species, it might act as an effective and economical barrier for controlling the spread of invasive species in riverine systems. Various technologies have been proposed as potential fish deterrents at locks and dams to reduce bigheaded carp (i.e., silver carp and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys spp.)) range expansion in the Upper Mississippi River (UMR). Lock and Dam (LD) 15 is infrequently at open-river condition (spillway gates completely open; hydraulic head across the dam <0.4 m) and has been identified as a potential location for fish deterrent implementation. We used acoustic telemetry to evaluate paddlefish passage at UMR dams and to evaluate seasonal and diel movement of paddlefish and bigheaded carp relative to environmental conditions and lock operations at LD 15. We observed successful paddlefish passage at all dams, with the highest number of passages occurring at LDs 17 and 16. Paddlefish residency events in the downstream lock approach of LD 15 occurred more frequently and for longer durations than residency events of bigheaded carp. We documented upstream passages completed by two individual paddlefish through the lock chamber at LD 15, and a single bighead carp completed upstream passage through the lock chamber during two separate years of this study. We identified four bigheaded carp and 19 paddlefish that made upstream passages through the spillway gates at LD 15 during this study. The majority of the upstream passages through the spillway gates for both species occurred during open river conditions. When hydraulic head was approximately 1-m or greater, we observed these taxa opt for upstream passage through the lock chamber more often than the dam gates. In years with infrequent open-river condition, a deterrent placed in the downstream lock approach may assist in meeting the management goal of reducing upstream passage of bigheaded carps but could also potentially affect paddlefish residency and passage. Continued study to understand the effects of deterrents on native fish could be beneficial for implementing an integrated bigheaded carp control strategy. Understanding fish behavior at UMR dams is a critical information need for river managers as they evaluate potential tools or technologies to control upstream expansion of bigheaded carp in the UMR.",no
University of Illinois College of Agricultural Consumer and Environmental Sciences,2019,"Chicago water pollution may be keeping invasive silver carp out of Great Lakes, study says",Marine Pollution Bulletin,148,,218-218,"Invasive silver carp have been moving north toward the Great Lakes since their accidental release in the 1970s. The large filter-feeding fish, which are known to jump from the water and hit anglers, threaten aquatic food webs as well as the $7 billion Great Lakes fishery. But, for the past decade, the invading front has not moved past Kankakee. A new study, led by scientists at the University of Illinois, suggests that Chicago's water pollution may be a contributing to this lack of upstream movement. Cory Suski, associate professor in the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences and co-author of the study, de- scribes the water coming down from the Chicago Area Waterway as a toxic soup. However, a lot of those chemicals go away near Kankakee, nobody is quite sure why. They might degrade or settle out, or the Kankakee River might dilute them, but for whatever reason, there is a stark change in water quality at that point. The researchers think the fish stop at Kankakee because they are responding negatively to compounds in the water flowing downstream from Chicago. They formulated their hypothesis after reading a 2017 water quality report from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). USGS researchers tracked changes in water chemistry in a single pocket of water as it moved from Chicago downstream through the Illinois River. Right near Kankakee, many of the pharmaceuticals, volatile organic compounds, and wastewater indicators dropped off the charts. Suski says many of these compounds have been shown in other studies to induce avoidance behaviours in fish, but his team did not look at behaviour. Instead, they examined gene expression patterns in blood and liver samples from silver carp at three locations along the Illinois River: at Kankakee, approximately 10 miles downstream near Morris, and 153 miles downstream near Havana. They found large differences in gene expression patterns between the Kankakee fish and the two downstream populations. Fish near Kankakee were turning on genes associated with clearing out toxins and turning off genes related to DNA repair and protective measures. Basically, their livers were working overtime and detoxifying pathways were very active. This did not occur in either of the downstream po- pulations. Suski stresses that his study was not designed to demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship between water pollution and silver carp movement, but the results hint at a compelling answer to a decade-old mystery. The researchers hope to follow up to show how the fish are metabolizing the pollutants, which will give them a better under- standing of which compounds are having the biggest effects. Regardless of which specific pollutants may be responsible for stopping silver carp, if that hypothesis is later proven, the results could have interesting implications for management.",no

Main stem navigation dams on the upper Mississippi River, long considered a deterrent to fish migration, may slow or prevent the spread of invasive fish species. As discharge increases, hydraulic head (i.e., difference between upstream elevation and downstream elevation) at these navigation dams decreases, which is believed to allow for easier fish passage. We used acoustic telemetry to investigate the occurrence, frequency, and timing of bigheaded carp passage of upper Mississippi River dams, along with factors related to successful dam passage. During 2013 through 2017, adult silver carp (H. molitrix), bighead carp (H. nobilis) and their hybrids (N = 358) were tracked throughout the upper Mississippi River. A total of 1078 dam passages by bigheaded carps (N = 158) were observed past 15 dams. Seventy-eight percent of dam passages occurred during April through July. Cox proportional hazards regression models indicated that both upstream and downstream dam passages by these species were strongly affected by hydraulic head height at the dam and water temperature, with dam passages increasing as hydraulic head decreased and water temperature increased. A few dams rarely experience low hydraulic head and passages of those dams by bigheaded carps were rare. This information can be used by managers to develop strategies (e.g., placement of deterrent technologies, targeted removal efforts) to slow the spread of these invasive species.",no

For an acoustic deterrent to be effective however, the hearing ability of bigheaded carp must be characterized. A previous study showed that bigheaded carp detected sound up to 3 kHz but this range is narrower than what has been reported for other ostariophysans. Therefore, silver and bighead carp frequency detection was evaluated in response to 100 Hz to 9 kHz using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). AEPs were recorded from 100 Hz to 5 kHz.

Furthermore, 79.8% of fish vectored away from the moving watercraft. The results suggest that jumping direction is not random and fish can localize the stimulus source.

Current research on deterrent technologies for bighead Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and silver carp H. molitrix have primarily focused on reducing upstream movement in large river lock approaches. However, there is also interest in excluding carp from smaller-scale locations. A water control structure at Emiquon Preserve, Lewistown, Illinois, USA reconnected the Preserve’s wetland lakes to the Illinois River, and is a pinch point that site managers seek to deter immigration of non-native fishes without restricting native fish movement. One possible deterrent strategy that was evaluated within the water control structure in 2017 was the use of a 100 hp boat motor acoustic stimulus. Two underwater speakers were installed in each of two culverts to discourage fish movement though the water control structure. Fish passage was monitored using a series of passive integrated transponder (PIT) antennas in a confined study area. A combination of 176 fish consisting of seven different species (native and non-native) were implanted with PIT tags and relocated downstream of the water control structure. Over 2 days of periodic playback of the acoustic stimulus, 29% of tagged silver carp that were detected crossed though the active underwater speaker array. The acoustic treatment did not significantly reduce silver carp or native centrarchid passage through the culverts. However, numerous silver carp were observed jumping out of the acoustically active culvert at the onset of the stimulus. The acoustic stimulus, especially the frequencies to which silver carp are most sensitive to (< 2000 Hz), rapidly attenuated in the water control structure (water depth 0.55–0.38 m).

No fish were found dead in the high-nitrogen ponds, but marked histological changes were found in livers and gills. Despite these changes, the specific growth rate of H.m. and An. increased significantly with NH3. Our pond results suggest that fish might be more tolerant to high ammonia concentrations in natural aquatic ecosystems than under laboratory conditions. Our finding from field experiments thus suggests that the existing regulatory limits for reactive nitrogen (NH3) established from lab toxicity tests might be somewhat too high at the ecosystem conditions. Field-scale chronic toxicity tests covering full life histories of fish and other aquatic organisms are therefore encouraged in order to optimize determination of the effects of ammonia in natural environments.

The total frequency and total density were 437.73 loci/Mb and 7713.16 bp/Mb, respectively. Among the 2–6 different nucleotide repeat types, SSRs were dominated by di-nucleotide repeats (204,873, 55.59%), and AC/GT was the most abundant motif. The number of SSRs on each chromosome was positively correlated with the length. The 13 pairs of markers developed were used to analyze the genetic diversity of four cultivated populations in Hubei Province. The results showed that the genetic diversity of the four populations was low, and the ranges of alleles (Na), effective alleles (Ne), observed heterozygosity (Ho), and Shannon’s index information (I) were 3.538–4.462, 2.045–2.461, 0.392–0.450, and 0.879–0.954, respectively. Genetic variation occurs mainly among individuals within populations (95.35%). UPGMA tree and Bayesian analysis showed that four populations could be divided into two different branches. Therefore, the genome-wide SSRs were effectively in genetic diversity analysis on H. molitrix.",no

In this study, silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) larvae were exposed to 0 (control), 1, 5, and 10 mu g/L Hg2+ for 2 weeks. Antioxidant ability, neurotoxicity, and thyroid hormones (THs) content were evaluated. In comparison with the control, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and the glutathione (GSH) activity were lower in silver carp exposed to 10 mu g/L Hg2+. The lowest catalase (CAT) activity was found in the 10 mu g/L Hg2+, while malondialdehyde (MDA) content was not significantly different among all groups. Compared with the control, monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity and nitric oxide (NO) content were significantly higher in the 10 mu g/L Hg2+, while acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity significantly decreased. Compared with the control, triiodothyronine (T3) content was significantly higher in the 1 mu g/L Hg2+ and significantly lower in the 10 mu g/L Hg2+; the 1 mu g/L and 5 mu g/L Hg2+ groups had significantly higher thyroxine (T4) content than the other groups. In the 1 mu g/L Hg2+, the integrated biomarker response (IBR) index value was the highest. In summary, exposure to Hg could decrease the antioxidant ability, cause changes in neurotoxic parameters, and induce disorders of the thyroid hormone system in silver carp larvae. The results of this study may contribute to the understanding of the adverse effects of chronic mercury poisoning on fish.",no

In Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, recent hydrological changes driven by the operation of Three Gorges Dam (TGD) and drought have caused a drastic loss of fishery resources. In response, managers have planned to build a sluice at Poyang Lake's outlet to manage the lake's water level and, as the sluice will unavoidably limit the river-lake migration of many fishery species, managers have also proposed implementing stock enhancement programs and restricting fisheries to sustain fisheries in the lake. In this study, we built and implemented a Poyang Lake Ecopath with Ecosim model to evaluate effects of water level management, stock enhancement, and fishery restriction on biomass of the four major Chinese carps: grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), bighead carp (H. nobilis), and black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus), of which all are river-lake migratory and important to fisheries. Results showed that the total biomass of the four major Chinese carps could increase with increases in water level, increases in stocking biomass, and decreases in fishing pressure. However, even in the best management effort scenario (i.e., highest water level, highest stocking biomass, and no fishing), simulated total biomass of the four major Chinese carps was still 16% lower than the biomass estimate in 2000, three years before the operation of TGD. These results suggest that a combination of managing water level, stocking, and restricting fisheries can substantially offset negative effects of hydrological changes on the four major Chinese carps, but may not be enough to restore the biomass of the four major Chinese carps to high levels that had occurred before the operation of TGD, because of the blockage of river-lake connectivity by the Poyang Lake sluice.",no

As the world's busiest inland river in regard to shipping, little attention has been paid to underwater noise pollution. In 2017, the underwater noise level in 25 riverside locations along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River mainly at night time were investigated by using passive acoustic monitoring method. Approximately 88% and 40% of the sampled sites exhibit noise levels exceeding the underwater acoustic thresholds of causing responsiveness and temporary threshold shift, respectively, in cetacean. Noise pollution may impose a high impact on fish with physostomous swim bladders and Weberian ossicles, such as silver carp, bighead carp, goldfish and common carp, whereas it may affect fish with physoclistous swim bladders and without Weberian ossicles, such as lake sturgeon and paddlefish, to a lesser extent. Noise levels reductions of approximately 10 and 20 dB were observed in the middle and lower reaches, respectively, of the Yangtze River over the 2012 level. The green development mode of the ongoing construction of green shipping in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, including the development of green shipping lanes, ports, ships and transportation organizations, may account for the alleviated underwater noise pollution.

Ground silver carp was diluted, and soluble proteins were separated by centrifugation and dried. The proximate composition (dry wt) of the protein powders averaged 82.42% protein, 3.25% lipid, and 14.50% ash. Average protein recovery yield was 11.78% with the better yields occurring at 20 degrees C (P < 0.05). Mineral profile revealed greater concentrations of Fe, Mg, P, and Na when compared to the initial homogenate. More saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids were recovered in the 4 degrees C powder and the least in the 40 degrees C powder (P < 0.05). Polyunsaturated fatty acids displayed a reverse trend, with the greatest concentration in the 40 degrees C powder and the least in the 4 degrees C powder (P < 0.05). The amino acid profile revealed that the protein powder met all FAO/WHO/UNO amino acid requirements for adults. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) revealed high amounts of low and medium molecular weight (MW) proteins (10-15 and 25-50 kDa, respectively). Two-dimensional (2-D) electrophoresis indicated that the low MW proteins possessed a neutral isoelectric point relative to that of the medium MW proteins. The protein powder was significantly less soluble (P < 0.05) than whey protein concentrate 80 at every pH tested (pH 3.0 to 11.0). Similar tendencies were seen when ionic strength was shifted (0.0 to 1.1 I; P < 0.05). Soluble protein powders derived from silver carp are nutrient rich and have physical characteristics resembling whey protein concentrate. Changes in process temperature had limited effects on protein powder composition. Practical ApplicationSoluble proteins contribute to 20 to 40% of fish protein and are soluble in neutral salt solutions. Much of the sarcoplasmic proteins are lost when they solubilize in processing water and are discarded similarly to how whey protein was once discarded during dairy processing. When government regulations on whey disposal were implemented, the dairy industry responded by repurposing the high-quality protein for human use and it is now a billion dollar industry.

Study objectives were to evaluate protein quality and safety of a silver carp sarcoplasm derived protein powder (CSP) compared to commercial protein supplements, casein, and whey.In vivoprotein quality assessment of CSP showed a lower (P < 0.05) protein digestibility corrected amino acid score compared to the commercial protein sources. Despite greater (P < 0.05) fecal amino acid excretion in casein-fed rats, there were no significant differences in liver and muscle amino acid profiles. All low (10% kcal) protein diets supported growth with the normal range. However, whey protein supplementation resulted in greater (P < 0.05) adiposity. CSP, casein, or whey-fed rats showed no differences in major organ weights, renal damage biomarkers, or bone indices. Collectively, results indicated CSP was safe with protein quality comparable to casein. Practical Application As much as 40 percent of protein in fish can be lost due to sarcoplasmic protein solubilization in processing wash water. Silver carp sarcoplasm protein powder may have similar commercial potential as a sustainable and nutritious alternative to whey and casein proteins.

The current northern invasion edge of Bigheaded Carp in the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) spans between Pools 14 and 20 because of limited passage at Lock and Dam (LD) 19. Mechanisms limiting adult Bigheaded Carp abundance above LD19 are unknown but may be due in part to lack of reproductive success influenced by adult abundance and environmental factors. Our objective was to investigate how relative adult biomass and river temperature and discharge affect maximum annual Bigheaded Carp larval production in the UMR using a Ricker stock-recruitment model. Adult Bigheaded Carp relative biomass (kg/h) was estimated annually with boat electrofishing and larvae were collected every 10 d between May and August 2014-2017 in Pools 14-20 in the UMR. Adult relative biomass ranged from 0.0 to 880.9 kg/h, whereas maximum annual larval densities ranged from 0.0 to 2,869.4 larvae/m(3). After accounting for variability among pools and years, the most supported linear Ricker stock-recruitment model indicated the number of recruits per spawner decreased with increasing adult relative biomass and increased with mean discharge. Our results highlight the importance of adult biomass and river discharge conditions for reproduction of Bigheaded Carp along leading edges of invasion. Management strategies that aim to maintain low adult abundance where reproduction is not yet occurring could help limit population increases via reproduction, whereas reducing high adult biomass (e.g., commercial harvest, barriers) may result in greater Bigheaded Carp reproductive output in the UMR.",no

Myosin from silver carp was dissolved in solutions at various pH (5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 8.0 and 9.0). Effects of pH on the particle size, intermolecular forces, and micro-morphology of myosin at low temperature were investigated. The structures of myosin assemblies were observed to be influenced by varying pH using the variations in the degree of protonation and surface charge state of myosin molecules. The low electrostatic repulsion in acidic conditions resulted in the assembly before unfolding of myosin, leading to a relatively high turbidity and UV absorption as well as a decreased solubility. Confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis showed that myosin assemblies with coarse filamentous structure were formed in acid conditions. In alkaline conditions, the increased electrostatic repulsion led to a higher rate of unfolding than assembly and exposure of more hydrophobic residues, as showed by increased S-0-ANS values and free SH contents. This relatively high rate of unfolding contributed to the formation of assemblies with a fine and ordered structure. At pH 7.0, the most active structure of myosin molecules was maintained as shown by the highest Ca2+-ATPase activity. Myosin assemblies with an ordered and uniform structure were obtained at pH 7.0.",no

In the chitosan coatings, when the chitosan combines with NPs by chemical bonds, the crystal lattice is slightly changed due to the modification of NPs. The chitosan coatings modified by NPs showed few cracks, among which sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) modified ZnO/TiO2/SiOx-chitosan (ZTS-CS) coating is proved to be the optimal one. The change of the freshness index and the texture of the fish balls are delayed by the coatings due to their gas permeability and antibacterial properties. The preservation properties of the chitosan coatings for Silver Carp fish balls are improved by in situ SiOx, and further improved by co-modification of ZnO/TiO2 NPs. Furthermore, the surface modification of ZnO/TiO2 NPs enhances the preservation properties of the chitosan coating. Practical Application In our previous study, in situ SiOx was found to improve antibacterial and preservation properties of chitosan coating, leading to extending shelf time of Sciaenops ocellatus. In order to further improve properties of chitosan coatings, we added nontoxic edible nano materials to the in situ SiOx chitosan coatings. In situ SiOx modified by ZnO/TiO2 NPs were synthesized, measured, and characterized in this study, and were applied for the preservation of silver carp fish balls.

Commercial cryoprotectant (8% w/w 1:1 sucrose-sorbitol blend, SuSo) and control (without cryoprotectant) groups were used for comparison. After six freeze-thaw cycles, the lowest actomyosin extractability, Ca2+-ATPase activity and total sulfhydryl content, along with the highest surface hydrophobicity of actomyosin, were observed in the control group (P < 0.05). On the contrary, the group with addition of 2 g of hydrolysate prepared by Protamex hydrolysis (PH-2) displayed the highest actomyosin extractability, Ca2+-ATPase activity and correspondingly, lowest surface hydrophobicity of actomyosin (P < 0.05). Total sulfhydryl content of actomyosin and textural properties of heat-set surimi gels were similar between samples with PH-2 and those with SuSo (P > 0.05). Differences in molecular weight distribution, total and free amino acid compositions between the hydrolysates prepared by Protamex and Alcalase hydrolysis were possible reasons attributing to their variable cryoprotective effects on freeze-thawed surimi. Results from this study clearly support that hydrolysate prepared by Protamex hydrolysis at an appropriate amount could serve as an effective cryoprotectant without increasing the sweetness of surimi products. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the hydrolysates follow a different cryoprotection mechanism compared to SuSo (sucrose-sorbitol blend).",no

Here, we used otolith microchemistry of Silver Carp from the Kansas River to reconstruct environmental histories as a means to assess the proportions of resident and transient individuals. Silver Carp within the Kansas River were predominantly residents with the majority of reproduction coming from within the Kansas River itself.

Lock and Dam 19 (LD19) is a high-head dam on the UMR that delineates downriver areas where bigheaded carps are well established from upriver pools where these species are less abundant and evidence of reproduction and recruitment are limited. Principal natal environments supporting recruitment of emerging bigheaded carp populations in the UMR are unknown. The objectives of this study were to (1) infer environments occupied during early-life stages by bigheaded carps collected in UMR Pools 19-21 during 2013-2014 using otolith microchemistry and stable isotope analyses, and (2) use early-life environment assignments and capture location to identify individuals that passed through LD19. Differences in multivariate water chemistry signatures (Sr:Ca, Ba:Ca and O-18) among the UMR, its tributaries, and the Missouri and Middle Mississippi rivers enabled development of a classification model for inferring early-life environment of bigheaded carps. Multiple sources of recruits, including from tributaries, have contributed to upriver expansion of bigheaded carps in the UMR. Sustainable control of bigheaded carps upstream of LD19 will likely require efforts to control local recruitment and immigration from downriver. The frequency of bigheaded carps collected in Pool 19 that were downstream of LD19 during early life suggests that bigheaded carps upstream of LD19 still predominantly consisted of immigrants from downriver during 2013-2014. Otolith chemistry provides an approach for assessing the extent to which changes in abundance of bigheaded carps upstream of LD19 are associated with local recruitment or immigration from downriver.",no

The objectives of this study were to identify trends in the fish communities and to characterize the community trajectory (i.e., directional or nondirectional) of the Illinois River, a large tributary to the Mississippi River, using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Although NMDS has been used to evaluate community trajectory in multivariate space over time in smaller rivers, there has been less attention given to larger rivers, which may exhibit different dynamics. To evaluate changes in large river fish communities, we used a long-term electrofishing monitoring dataset (1957-2013) that includes fish abundance data from six reaches of the Illinois River, Illinois, U.S.A. Temporal changes in Illinois River fish communities were evident in NMDS ordinations. Larger changes in NMDS ordinations were associated with improving water quality conditions, whereas the invasion of bigheaded carp (silver carp Hypophthalimichtys molitrix and bighead carp H. nobilis) produced smaller and less variable changes. Across all six reaches of the Illinois River, the trajectory of fish communities was directional in multivariate space, with no return to an initial or predisturbance condition. Community trajectory in larger and more heavily-modified rivers may be substantially different and more complex than that of smaller and less heavily modified rivers.",no

Previous reports were of a few individuals at a few locations; however, effort to capture juveniles of this size was likely less in previous years. Determining the origin, frequency, and timing of the reproductive events that led to this large year-class is important for determining control strategies. We used otolith microstructure and microchemistry from age-0 Silver Carp to estimate timing and frequency of spawning and early life environments of these fish. Hatch dates were determined from the lapillus otoliths of 190 age-0 Silver Carp (16-231 mm), and early life environments were identified from otolith microchemistry for 124 of these fish (64-231 mm).

Many adaptations, including chemical cues, benefit shoaling groups by informing members of a possible impending predatory threat. Bighead (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carps (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) are widely dispersed invasive fishes that spend much of their first year at a size vulnerable to predation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the fright response of juvenile bighead and silver carps when exposed to alarm cues from conspecific and heterospecific fishes. Groups of carps were exposed to 5 mL of alarm cue from either bighead carp, silver carp, golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), or fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). Behavior was recorded before and after the application of the treatment. Our results indicate that both species were unable to recognize chemical alarm cues from North American cypriniforms, yet both were able to recognize conspecific alarm cues. However, the two species of bigheaded carps respond to conspecific chemicals differently. Silver carp increase distance among individuals, whereas bighead carp reduce distance between individuals. Both show a reduction in activity after chemical application. Though both species recognize conspecific alarm cues, bighead carp exhibit similar fright patterns when exposed to alarm chemicals of silver carp, yet no behavioral responses were detected in silver carp when exposed to alarm chemicals of bighead carp. An understanding of fright response in bighead and silver carps aids understanding of predator interactions and ecological roles of these fishes, and can be utilized in population management applications.",no

In particular, this method is being applied by many jurisdictions surrounding the Great Lakes to monitor for the potential presence of Asian carp. We developed two multiplex quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions for the simultaneous testing for eDNA from the four species of Asian carp that have been identified as potential invaders into the Great Lakes [bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), black carp (Mylophollyngodon piceus), and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) along with internal controls to test for false positive results due to sample contamination. The assays are highly sensitive and have the ability to detect trace amounts of carp DNA in laboratory controls. The use of a multiplex design allows for simultaneous testing for numerous species, reducing processing and handling times, lowering costs and reducing the amount of DNA extract required for testing. The multiplex assays described in this study may be readily applied to Asian carp monitoring programs, and are currently being used to support surveillance efforts in the Canadian waters of Lake Erie, Lake Huron and Lake Ontario for all four species of Asian carp.

How to turn such waste into a useful product is an important issue. In this study, acid-soluble collagen (ASC) and pepsin-soluble collagen (PSC) were extracted from silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) scales using a new acid-enzyme combined method. The results showed that the extraction yields of ASC and PSC were 5.09% and 12.06%, respectively. Then amino acid analysis, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), circular dichroism (CD) and ultra-sensitive differential scanning calorimetry (US-DSC) were used to study their composition, properties and structure. Amino acid analysis indicated that ASC and PSC were type I collagens with 34% glycine and 20% imino acid (Pro and Hyp). The results of SDS-PAGE and FT-IR analysis showed that ASC and PSC were similar to those of the standard type I collagen. CD indicated that the triple helical structure of both ASC and PSC were still retained. And the transition from triple helix to random coil of ASC and PSC were 34.26 degrees C and 34.47 degrees C, respectively. For the first time, the collagen yields of silver carp scales were calculated. Meanwhile, their composition, properties and structure were characterized. These results may offer theoretical support for the development of silver carp scales related to reusing technology to control waste.",no

In order to understand the changes of fish assemblage structure in the process of ecological stocking and effectively, the existing fish community in Daye Lake which was divided into 9 sites was evaluated in the summer of 2019 and 2020, and fish resources were investigated by traditional fishing and eDNA metabarcoding technology. The results showed that 33 species belonging to 18 genera, 6 families and 4 orders of fish were investigated in Daye Lake based on traditional fishing methods. Among them, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Hypophthalmichthys nobilis were the dominant species in Daye Lake all year round, and the dominant group was omnivorous, middle-lower fish. And the fish communities at the same point at different times were similar, the separation degree of fish communities was relatively high among different locations. Based on eDNA metabarcoding technology, the mitochondrial COI (cytochrome oxidase I) and 12S rRNA gene regions of eDNA were amplified respectively. A total of 10 species of freshwater lake fish were detected, of which 7 were detected together with traditional methods. Alpha and Beta diversity analysis showed that GJQ had the lowest species diversity, DW and LJH had the highest species diversity, and the biodiversity of adjacent sites was relatively similar. This study proved that ecological stocking will not have a great impact on the diversity of fish populations in lakes. At the same time, it proved the effectiveness of eDNA metabarcoding technology in fish diversity investigation.",no

Here, this study aims to develop a colloidal gold immunochromatographic strip based on gold-labeled microwells to screen the residues of FQs on site. Materials and methods The Protein A Magarose Beads affinity chromatography method was adopted to purify the ascites against FQs. By using a strategy of heterologous coating antigen, different coating antigens are applied to detect FQs. The gold-labeled microwell immunochromatographic assay was used to improve the sensitivity of the test strip by the advanced reaction of antigen and antibody. Results The antibodies were verified to be of high purity up to 99%, and the titer reached 1:1 024 000. The combination (enoxacin-OVA and the antibody) detected the 4 banned FQs (pefloxacin, PEF; norfloxacin, NOR; lomefloxacin, LOM; ofloxacin, OFL) with the 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50) values ranging from 1.3 to 2.1 ng/mL and cross-reactions ranging from 67.3% to 106.1%. The analysis of spiked crucian carp, silver carp, grass carp, and shrimp samples showed that the limit of detection for PEF, NOR, LOM, and OFL was 4 mu g/kg. A comparative study with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) demonstrated that the assay provided an effective screening tool for the rapid detection of FQs residues. Conclusions The results indicated that the test strip can realize full coverage recognition of the 4 banned FQs and has good accuracy, specificity, reproducibility, and stability; therefore, they are more suitable for rapid detection of FQs in aquatic products.",no

This study aims to examine the effect of temperature on metabolic scaling and to verify the links between metabolic scaling and surface area scaling at both the whole body and the cell levels. The routine metabolic rate (RMR), gill surface area (GSA), ventilation frequency (VF), red blood cell surface area (S-RBC), and metabolic rate (MRRBC) were determined in silver carp, and their mass-scaling exponents were analyzed at 10 and 25 degrees C. These results showed that body mass and temperature independently affected the RMR, GSA, and VF, suggesting constant scaling exponents of RMR (0.772), GSA (0.912), and VF (-0.282) with changing temperature. The RMR at 25 degrees C was 2.29 times higher than that at 10 degrees C, suggesting increased metabolic demand at a higher temperature. The results showed that the RMR increased, while the scaling exponents of RMR, GSA, and VF remained unchanged with increasing temperature. These results support the view that the scaling of oxygen supply capacity importantly affects metabolic scaling. The S-RBC did not change with either temperature or body mass. However, the MRRBC increased by 5.48 times from 10 to 25 degrees C but did not change with body mass. As the scaling exponents of RMR did not change between temperatures, the results indicate that no obvious link exists between the scaling of both the cell size and cell metabolic rate and the metabolic scaling of silver carp.",no

In this work, we extracted aquatic gelatin from silver carp scales and studied the effects of antioxidant types (watersoluble and lipid-soluble types) on the stabilization, lipid oxidation, and in vitro digestion behaviors of silver carp scale gelatin-stabilized fish oil-loaded emulsions. Vitamin C (VC), a water-soluble antioxidant, and vitamin E (VE), a lipid-soluble antioxidant, had no obvious effects on the appearance, droplet size distribution, and droplet stability of the emulsion. VC slowed the liquid-gel transition of the emulsions at room temperature. The emulsion creaming stability decreased with the increase of VC concentration, whereas it increased with the increase of VE concentration. Lipid oxidation hierarchy of emulsion groups at room temperature were VC<VE<control<pure oil. Free fatty acids were mainly released from the silver carp scale gelatin-stabilized emulsions in the simulated intestinal fluid. Moreover, compared with the control group, VC increased the free fatty acid release percentages, whereas VE decreased them.

MP- or Tween 80-stabilized camellia seed oil emulsions with different droplet sizes were prepared and added to MPs to prepare composite gels. The oil droplet size of the Tween 80-stabilized emulsion was significantly smaller (p < 0.05) than that of the MP-stabilized emulsion with the same homogenization speed. However, polymerization of Tween 80-stabilized emulsions during the preparation of the composite gels was found. Composite gels with the MP-stabilized emulsions of a small droplet size showed significantly improved water-holding capacity, texture, and dynamic rheological properties. Interfacial shear rheology studies revealed that the storage modulus (G') of the MP-stabilized emulsion composite gels was higher than that of the Tween 80-stabilized gels, and the tan delta of the MP-stabilized oil emulsion composite gels was smaller than that of the Tween 80-stabilized gels, indicating that stronger elastic gel structures were formed. These results suggested that the IPF formed in the MP-stabilized emulsion helped stabilize the oil droplets embedded in the protein gel network, and the smaller the droplet size, the more stable the composite gel.

Measurable values of TDCIPP have been found in the environment and within biota. Many toxicological assessments have shown that TDCIPP could cause developmental toxicity and oxidative stress in fish. In this study, we focused on the effects of TDCIPP on the growth and oxidative stress of an important commercial fish species in China, silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix). Fish larvae was exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations (0.05, 0.5, 5 and 50 mu g/L) of TDCIPP for 7, 14 and 28 days. Simultaneously, the transcription levels of genes associated with the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor (GH/IGF) axis and the antioxidative enzymes were examined. The body length and body mass of silver carp larvae decreased significantly only under exposure to 5 and 50 mu g/L of TDCIPP at 14 days compared with the control group, while differences on those paraments were observed at 0.05, 0.5, 5 and 50 mu g/L when larvae were exposed for 28 days. The observation evidenced the time-and dose-dependent growth inhibitions caused by TDCIPP on silver carp larvae. Exposure to TDCIPP also decreased the contents of GH and IGF1 in fish attended by significant down-regulation of gh and igf1. Moreover, TDCIPP up-regulated the expression of cat, sod1 and gstt followed by an increase of the activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH), but the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were decreased. These results suggested that growth inhibition and oxidative stress co-occurred in silver carp larvae after exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of TDCIPP accompanied by the abnormal expression of genes which associated with the GH/IGF axis and antioxidative enzymes.",no

Understanding the mechanism by which the environment impacts the gut microbial communities of aquatic animals is crucial for assessing and managing aquatic ecosystem health. Here, we proposed a simplified framework for the colonization and dynamics of gut microbial communities. Then, to quantify the colonization of environmental microbes in the wild fish gut, the current study used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to obtain the structure of the water environmental microbial community and the gut microbial community in 10 wild fish populations (Leiocassis crassilabris, Leiocassis longirostris, Pelteobagrus vachelli, Silurus asotus, Siniperca chuatsi, Coilia brachygnathus, Aristichthys nobilis, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Coreius heterodon, and Xenocypris argentea) from the Wuhan section of the Yangtze River, and the relationship of these microbial communities was analyzed. The results identified that in most individuals, approximately 80% of gut microbes [at the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level] were shared with the water environmental microbial community (except for individuals of Siniperca chuatsi and Coilia brachygnathus, approximately 74%). In approximately 80% of individuals, more than 95% of microbial species (OTUs) in the gut were transient. For fish species, more than 99% of microbial species (OTUs) that were introduced into the gut were transient. Nearly 79% of OTUs and 89% of species of water environmental microbes could be introduced into the fish gut. Driven by the introduction of transient microbes, fishes with similar feeding habits had similar gut microbial communities. The results indicated that for adult wild fishes, most gut microbiota were transient from the environmental microbiota that were related to fish feeding habits. We therefore encourage future research to focus on environmental microbiota monitoring and management to promote the better conservation of aquatic animals. It was important to note that, because of various influence factors, interspecific differences and individual variations on gut microbial community characteristics, the quantification of gut microbes in the current work was approximate rather than accurate. We hope that more comparable research could be conducted to outline the quantitative characteristics of the relationship between gut microbial community and aquatic environment microbial community as soon as possible.",no

Surimi is usually made from marine fish, but Asian carp have been widely used for surimi production in China. The quality of surimi is affected by various factors, including the processing methods and food additives, such as polysaccharides, protein, salt, and cryoprotectant. With an impending shortage of marine fish due to overfishing and depletion of fish stocks, Asian carp have a potential to serve as an alternative raw material for surimi products thanks to their high abundancy, less emissions of greenhouse gases from farming, desirable flesh color, and sufficient gel forming ability.

They primarily inhabit and breed in the Yangtze River. Unfortunately, the construction and operation of the Gezhouba Dam and the Three Gorges Dam have dramatically changed the hydrodynamic conditions in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, leading to a sharp decline in the reproduction rates of these carp. The egg abundance of the four species of carp downstream from the Three Gorges Dam reached 8.35 billion in 1965, but abundance during 2005-2012 was only 0.25 billion. One of the main reasons was that the hydrodynamic conditions of the spawning ground could not meet the four species’ breeding requirements. However, due to the limitations of traditional detection tools, the spawning characteristics of these four species of carp were still unclear. In this study, the ultrasonic telemetry and a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model were utilized to build the habitat suitability index (HSI) curves for the four species of carp. The habitat suitability model was then built based on HSI curves to assess spawning habitat quantity under different flow conditions. Finally, the habitat suitability model in the Yidu spawning ground was validated using 32 groups of sampling data in 2015 and 2017. The statistical results showed that the most suitable velocity ranged from 0.78 m/s to 0.93 m/s. The most suitable water depth ranged from 14.56 m to 16.35 m, and the most suitable Froude number ranged from 0.049 to 0.129. The habitat suitability model simulation results indicated that when the discharge was between 15,000 m3/s and 21,300 m3/s, the weighted usable area (WUA) values in both the Yidu and Zhicheng spawning grounds would remain at a high level. The validation results showed that most spawning activities occurred at a high level of WUA, and that the daily spawning egg numbers increased with the WUA value. Therefore, discharges of between 15,000 m3/s and 21,300 m3/s could be recommended as ecological operation target flows. We propose a feasible ecological operation scheme by setting the initial flow at 15,000 m3/s and maintaining the daily discharge increase at 1500 m3/s for 4 days.",no

As NaCl replaced by 0.32% and 0.63% CaCl2, surimi gels presented better textural properties, breaking force and rheological properties, while 0.95%, 1.27% and 1.58% CaCl2 led to the deterioration of gel strength. With the addition of CaCl2, water holding capacity (WHC) decreased significantly (p < .05), the T-23 relaxation time decreased and the proportion of T-23 increased. Compared with control, the sulphydryl content in surimi gel with 0.63% CaCl2 increased by 23.61% and the solubility decreased by 17.31%. Furthermore, the Raman spectra data demonstrated that more beta-sheet structures and random coils were induced in surimi gels prepared with CaCl2. Then surimi with and without CaCl2 was used as food-ink for three-dimensional (3D) printing, it indicated that surimi with 0.32% and 0.63% CaCl2 could effectively improve the 3D printability.",no

However, data are scarce regarding the antibiotic resistance in fish themselves. Herein, the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were assessed in the gut of four major Chinese freshwater carp (i.e., silver carp, grass carp, bighead carp, and crucian carp) from food retail markets. Results show that the abundances of target ARGs (e.g., tetA, tetO, tetQ, tetW, sull, sulII, and bla(TEM-1)) and class 1 integrase (intl1) were in the range 9.4 x 10(-6) - 1.6 x 10(-1) and 6.7 x 10(-5) - 5.2 x 10(-2) gene copies per 16S rRNA gene, respectively. The sull, sulII, and tetQ strongly correlated with silver and mercury resistance genes (e.g., silE and merR). The microbial taxa of fish gut could be partly separated among retail markets based on the PCA analysis. About 15.0% of the OTUs in fish gut were shared and 74.5% of the shared OTUs were identified as Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. These phyla may constitute the core microbiota in the guts of the four Chinese freshwater carp. The possible ARG hosts were revealed based on the network analysis, and the presence of pathogen-associated resistant genera in fish gut highlights the need to fully understand their potential human health risks.

Compared with KGM, deacetylated KGM (DKGM) weakened the water-holding capacity, but increased the gel strength of surimi gels. The storage modulus (G ') and loss modulus (G '') of surimi showed an upward trend, and the aggregation rate of surimi with DKGM changed. The number of ionic bonds of mixed surimi gels increased on the whole, but those of hydrogen bonds declined; a hydrophobic interaction was the main driving force, and improved with the DDs of DKGM. FT-IR results indicated that the deacetylation of KGM had a slight influence on the secondary structure of the proteins. SDS-PAGE results showed that DKGM enhanced the intensity of the main heavy chains of myosin and actin. Examination of the network structure of the surimi gels revealed that DKGM might combine around the filaments of myofibrillar proteins like a rosary through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. As a consequence, the myfibrillar protein aggregation was changed and the microstructures of the surimi became more compact and fibrous. The results indicated that the deacetylation of KGM led to an increase in hydrophobicity, which influenced the hydrophobic interaction of the myofibrillar proteins. As a result, the aggregation of the myofibrillar proteins was promoted and the physico-chemical properties of the surimi gel were improved.",no

The sensor enables the analysis of H2S with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.81 mu M, and it exhibited excellent selectivity toward H2S against other volatile components generated from chicken breast and silver carp during spoilage. By these virtues, the sensor presented visible color changes from yellow to colorless by in situ and nondestructively sensing H2S generated from chicken breast and silver carp in a packaging system.

Firstly, RACNs were extracted from roselle dehydrated calyxes. Secondly, SPVA aqueous solution was obtained with a mass rate of 2: 1 (starch/PVA). Thirdly, the colorimetric films were fabricated by immobilizing 30, 60 and 120 mg RACNs/100 g starch into SPVA matrix with casting/solvent evaporation method. FTIR spectra of the colorimetric films showed that RACNs were successfully immobilized into the SPVA matrix. X-ray diffraction spectra and SEM micrographs indicated that the crystallinity of PVA was reduced during the film-forming process and the compatibility between starch and PVA was improved, owing to the presence of RACNs. The incorporation of RACNs led to a decrease of water content and tensile strength and an increase of elongation at break of the colorimetric films compared with the SPVA film. The color stability test showed that the colorimetric films were stable at refrigeration temperature and room temperature up to 14 days with relative color changes below than 5%. The colorimetric films with lower content of RACNs were found more sensitive towards ammonia. An application trial was conducted to monitor the freshness of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) at refrigeration temperature. The colorimetric films presented visible color changes over time due to a variety of basic volatile amines known as total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N). Hence, these colorimetric films can be used to monitor the real-time fish freshness for intelligent packaging. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",no

Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), a species filter-feeding planktivorous fish, feed on particle between 4 and 85 mu m in size, and the respiratory process works together with feeding mechanism when filtering plankton from water. The aim of this study was to assess the physiological response of silver carp exposed to 5 mu m polystyrene microspheres during 48 h of exposure followed by 48 h of depuration through the gill histology, and oxidative stress biomarkers in intestine. The results revealed that microplastics can pass through the whole digestive tract of silver carp and be excreted by feces. Low microplastic concentration (80 mu g/L) induced oxidative stress and up-regulation of TUB84 and HSP70 gene in intestine, and silver carp have ability to recover after the exposure to microplastic was removed. High microplastic concentration (800 mu g/L) definitely cause significant damage to gills and intestines, in this situation, far beyond the possibility of fish own repair, and even when the threaten removed, silver carp can't recovery soon.

Myowater mobility and distribution were altered by stunning stress, in which gill cut facilitated the migration of immobilized water and free water, thus enhancing the centrifugation loss. In addition, stunning stress promoted the activation of endogenous proteases and the release of cathepsin B and L from lysosomes to myofibrils, which showed significant (P < 0.01) correlations with decreased shear force and elevated myofibril fragmentation index of fillets.

However, the quantity of bighead carp and its effect on water quality and plankton community have been the focus of debate among ecologists. Herein, in order to more accurately simulate the environmental conditions of lakes, we selected earthen ponds with large areas adjacent to Lake Qiandao from May to August in 2016 to study the responses of water quality condition and plankton community to a gradient of bighead carp stocked alone. Experimental groups with different densities of carp stocked were set as follows: 12.1 (LF), 23.5 (MF), and 32.5 g/m(3) (HF), and a control group with no fish (NF). Results showed that total phosphorus (TP) in the fish-containing groups considerably decreased, and the lowest chlorophyll-a concentration (chl-a) was detected in the MF group. The biomass accumulation of the crustacean zooplankton was suppressed after carp was introduced, but the diversity, richness, and evenness of the crustacean zooplankton were weakly affected, except in the HF group. Phytoplankton biomass especially that of cyanobacteria was grazed rapidly by fish in the MF and HF groups and biodiversity indices were considerably increased in the fish-containing groups, especially in the late stages of the experiment. At a fish stocking density of 23.5-38.8 g/m(3), the highest efficiency in controlling cyanobacteria and promoting water condition was achieved, and the impact on zooplankton diversity was weak.

Bacterial composition in water column varied with progress of the experiment. Some bacteria from Novozymes Pond Plus and Effective Microorganisms could colonize in the tanks but did not dominate in bacterial community. This study reveals that the competition between the exogenous bacteria and native bacteria might be a factor determining the efficacy of the microbial products in improving water quality.",no

Biological invasions have been shown to be linked to the genetic properties of alien host species. It is thus plausible that the holobiont, the host, and its associated microbiome act as an entity to drive invasion success. The bighead carp and silver carp (bigheaded carps), invasive species that exhibit extensive hybridization in the Mississippi River Basin (MRB), provided a unique model to test the holobiont hypothesis of invasion. Here, we investigated the microbiomes of foreguts and hindguts in bigheaded carps and their reciprocal hybrids reared in aquaculture ponds using 16S amplicons and the associated gene prediction. We found an admixed pattern in the gut microbiome community in bigheaded carp hybrids. The hybrid gut microbiomes showed special characteristics such as relatively high alpha diversity in the foregut, an increasing dissimilarity between foreguts and hindguts, and a remarkable proportion of genes coding for putative enzymes related to their digestion of main food resources (Cyanobacteria, cellulose, and chitin). The pond-reared hybrids had advantageous features in genes coding for putative enzymes related to their diet. The above results collectively suggested that the gut microbiomes of hybrids could be beneficial to their local adaptation (e.g., food resource utilization), which might have facilitated their invasion in the MRB. The gut microbial findings, along with the intrinsic genomic features likely associated with life-history traits revealed in our recent study, provide preliminary evidence supporting the holobiont hypothesis of invasion.",no

The MG's breaking force, deformation, gel strength, and water-holding capacity (WHC) increased as the salt concentration increased. The intrinsic fluorescence intensity of the samples initially decreased and then increased, reaching the lowest when the NaCl concentration was 2.5%. The result of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that large aggregates were formed by protein-protein interaction in the MG containing 2.5% or 3.0% NaCl, decreasing the protein band intensity. It was also found that with the addition of NaCl, the phosphorus content initially increased and then decreased, reaching the maximum when the NaCl concentration was 2% or 2.5%, which was similar to the changing trend of actin band intensity reported in the results of Western blot. These results revealed that the amount of salt used had a significant effect on the degree of phosphorylation of the MG protein. The increase in phosphorylation was linked to improved gelling properties, which could lead to new ideas for manufacturing low-salt surimi products in the future.",no

In a dark featureless square enclosure, groups of 3 fish were tracked and the distance of each fish from speakers and their swimming trajectories relative to sound pressure and particle acceleration were analyzed before, and then while an outboard motor sound was played. All three species exhibited negative phonotaxis during the first two exposures after which they ceased responding. The median percent time fish spent near the active speaker for the first two trials decreased from 7.0% to 1.3% for silver carp, 7.9% to 1.1% for bighead carp, and 9.5% to 3% for common carp. Notably, when close to the active speaker fish swam away from the source and maintained a nearly perfect 0 degrees orientation to the axes of particle acceleration. Fish did not enter sound fields greater than 140 dB (ref. 1 mu Pa). These results demonstrate that carp avoid complex sounds in darkness and while initial responses may be informed by sound pressure, sustained oriented avoidance behavior is likely mediated by particle motion. This understanding of how invasive carp use particle motion to guide avoidance could be used to design new acoustic deterrents to divert them in dark, turbid river waters.",no

Sorensen",2018,A physiologically inspired agent-based approach to model upstream passage of invasive fish at a lock-and-dam,Ecological Modelling,382,,18-32,"The ability of fish to swim upstream through regions of swiftly flowing water is ultimately dependent on their physiological capacity. Swimming performance, the relationship between swim speed and time-to-fatigue, has been used to design fishways and identify barriers to fish movement. However, existing numerical models do not all capture the variability in swimming abilities nor the turbulent, unsteady, and three-dimensional aspect of natural flows. This deficiency is particularly problematic for fish species whose behavior is poorly understood (i.e., invasive fish) and at sites with complex flow patterns. Here, we combine species-specific swimming performance with high resolution abstractions of fluid flow in a new agent-based framework to model fatigue of upstream swimming fish under turbulent flow conditions. Our model simulates fish paths, in the absence of information on their behavioral tendencies, based on a rules-set aimed at fish swimming as far upstream as possible before complete exhaustion by selecting the path of least fatigue. We demonstrate how this model functions by examining theoretical passage of invasive silver carp, Hypopthalmichthys molitrix, and bighead carp, H. nobilis, as well a native fish, the lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, through a typical Mississippi River lock-and-dam (Lock-and-Dam #8 near Genoa, WI). The model then tests whether passage could be reduced by altering spillway gate operations. Model results suggest that passage of all three species is low under current gate operations and that passage of both carp species could be further reduced by about half through minor changes in spillway gate operation without apparent impacts on navigation, scour, or lake sturgeon passage. Model results are qualitatively consistent with observed passage rates monitored by other studies at similar lock-and-dams and are consistent with the possibility that the model likely overestimates passage rates by relying on physiological data only. This approach could be exported to other applications and fish species to help manage and control fish migration and dispersal, especially for fish whose behavior and ecology are poorly understood and not presently quantifiable.",no

Su",2019,Lake michigan's suitability for bigheaded carp: The importance of diet flexibility and subsurface habitat,Freshwater Biology,64,11,1921-1939,"As bighead (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix)-collectively bigheaded carp (BHC)-arrive at Lake Michigan's doorstep, questions remain as to whether there is sufficient food to support these invasive filter-feeding fishes in the upper Laurentian Great Lakes. Previous studies suggest that suitable BHC habitat is limited to a few productive, nearshore areas. However, those studies did not consider the influence of BHC's diet plasticity or the presence of spatially-discrete subsurface prey resources. This study aimed to characterise Lake Michigan's suitability for BHC and evaluate the importance of these considerations in habitat suitability assessments. We used simulated outputs of prey biomass (phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detritus) and water temperature from a three-dimensional biophysical model of Lake Michigan to evaluate growth rate potential (GRP, quantitative index of habitat suitability) of adult BHC throughout the entire volume of the lake. Our GRP model applied a foraging model and a bioenergetics model to translate prey concentrations and water temperatures into habitat quality indexed by individual fish growth rate. We defined suitable habitat as habitats that can support GRP >= 0 g g(-1) day(-1). We developed six feeding scenarios to evaluate the impact of diet flexibility and subsurface prey resources on suitable habitat quantity. Scenarios were defined by the number of prey types the fish could consume and the depths at which they could feed (surface or whole water column). Consistent with previous studies, we found that habitats with the highest quality were concentrated near river mouths and in eutrophic areas of Green Bay. However, in contrast to previous studies, we found suitable offshore habitat for bighead carp owing to our added considerations of diet plasticity and subsurface prey resources. For silver carp, these considerations extended suitable habitat within Green Bay and in some tributary-influenced nearshore areas, but offshore areas remained predominantly unsuitable in all feeding scenarios. Differences in simulated habitat suitability between these two species probably reflect differences in energy density and mass of the specific fishes we used in our model. However, reports of these two species in environments where they coexist indicate that bighead carp grow at faster rates than silver carp, as our model simulated. Our vertical analysis at Muskegon, MI, U.S.A. indicates that subsurface temperature and prey biomass are not only sufficient to support bighead carp growth but provide maximum habitat quality during late summer stratification. Overall, our study demonstrates that BHC are capable of surviving and growing in much larger areas of Lake Michigan than predicted by previous studies, and thus suggests that the risk of establishment is not sufficiently reduced by low plankton concentrations. Maps generated by our model identified the potential for cross-lake migration corridors that may facilitate and accelerate lake-wide movements. We believe these maps could be used to prioritise surveillance protocols by identifying areas to which BHC might spread upon entering the lake. More broadly, this research demonstrates how the physiology and trophic ecology of BHC contributes to their high invasive capacity and can permit their survival in novel environments.",no

We evaluated the potential consequences of a proposed barrier on the Illinois River Waterway, meant to inhibit the spread of silver and bighead carps, to the continued recovery of native fishes in the Des Plaines River following water quality improvements. We compared changes in upstream cumulative species richness and community structure from 1983 to 2013 in the DuPage River, an adjacent tributary with an impassable dam, to the area upstream of a newly proposed barrier on the Des Plaines River where fish can currently pass through a navigational lock. Fewer species displayed truncated distributions upstream of the passable lock and dam (n = 18) compared with the impassable dam (n = 23). Due to water quality improvements in the Illinois River as a whole, cumulative species richness downstream of both dams steadily increased over time. Richness also increased upstream of the passable dam but plateaued upstream of the impassable dam. Fifteen to 18 species accounted for differences in community structure between areas downstream and upstream of either dam. Most species (78-100%) were found in greater relative abundance downstream of the impassable dam, and only 53% were found in greater relative abundance downstream of the passable dam. The truncation in species richness and abundance at the impassable dam foreshadows the potential consequences of an indiscriminate barrier on native fishes and the continued recovery of native assemblages.",no

Bigheaded Carp recruited in large numbers in the LaGrange Reach of the Illinois River during the summer of 2014. This provided an opportunity to determine whether native piscivorous fish prey upon invasive carp when they are abundant. Using electrofishing and fyke nets in the LaGrange Reach (August 1-November 8, 2014), we sampled native predatory fish (n = 1,472) for stomach content analysis. Fish community data from the Upper Mississippi River Restoration Program's Long-Term Resource Monitoring was used to quantify prey abundance (fish < 100 mm) in the study area and indicated that bigheaded carp represented 9% of available prey. Stomach content analysis revealed that the frequency of occurrence of juvenile bigheaded carp was greater than 15% in Shortnose Gar Lepisosteus platostomus, White Bass Morone chrysops, Black Crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus, Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus, Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu, Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, White Crappie Pomoxis annularis, Yellow Perch Perca flavescens, Flathead Catfish Pylodictis olivaris, Freshwater Drum Aplodinotus grunniens, and Yellow Bass Morone mississippiensis. Predators sampled in August and September foraged more heavily on juvenile bigheaded carp than those sampled in October and November. Electivity analysis suggested that juvenile bigheaded carp were selected over native forage by White Bass, Black Crappie, and Shortnose Gar, as these predators continued consuming them even as availability declined. Our results imply that native piscivores in the Illinois River consume and sometimes prefer juvenile bigheaded carp as prey. These results suggest that native predators might play a role in regulating bigheaded carp recruitment and that negative impacts to predators in areas of dense carp populations might be somewhat mitigated by the consumption of juvenile bigheaded carp.""",no

Otolith oxygen isotope ratios (delta O-18) and elemental ratios (Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca) were compared to values of isotope and elemental ratios in water from putative ELEs to assign the ELE for each fish.

Changes in species dominance has been documented by a 25-year fish community dataset encompassing six reaches of the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. Specifically, common carp (Cyprinus carpio) abundance has declined across all reaches, whereas silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) have increased in abundance in the southern three reaches. To test whether signals in the data were consistent with regime transitions, changes in body-size patterns and trends in functional biomass and variance of functional biomass of the fish community were assessed. I further explored biomass thresholds relative to transitions. Shifts in body-size aggregations and trends in functional biomass support hypotheses that transitions from common carp dominance to a more functional diverse community represent alternate regimes. Results indicate such transitions occurred in the early 2000s for the two most northern reaches, and that the third most northern reach is nearing this transition. In the southern reaches, results indicate that transitions from common carp dominance to silver and bighead carp dominance also represent alternate regimes. Regime transitions support biomass thresholds between 8000 and 10,000 g per unit of day electrofishing effort of common carp and between 20 and 2000 g per unit effort in silver and bighead carp. Consistencies across reaches with similar dominance patterns provide support that reinforcing feedbacks, unique to the functional attributes of the dominant species, occur at similar biomass levels. Building knowledge of such feedback mechanisms is imperative to effectively manage for desired regimes.",no

The adaptive capacity of an ecosystem, its general resilience, is a conceptual framework for considering how a system will respond to such changes. We sought to apply aspects of three general resilience principles (diversity and redundancy, connectivity, and controlling variables) to our understanding of floodplain-river ecosystem structure and function. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach in a case study of the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS). In doing so, we developed ten indicators that highlight important structural and functional aspects of this floodplain-river ecosystem, and likely underlie the capacity of large rivers to cope with environmental change and disturbance. We developed diversity and redundancy indicators for aquatic habitats, patterns of floodplain inundation, and fish communities. Connectivity indicators included metrics of longitudinal and lateral connections. Controlling variable indicators included deviations from historic water surface elevation fluctuations, water clarity, nutrient concentrations, and aquatic invasive species. This set of indicators provides a simple description of the adaptive capacity of four distinct reaches of the UMRS: Upper Impounded, Lower Impounded, Unimpounded Reaches of the Upper Mississippi River and the entire Illinois River. High aquatic habitat diversity and redundancy, fish functional diversity and redundancy, and water clarity, and the scarcity of invasive fish species are all factors that likely contribute to the high general resilience of the Upper Impounded Reach. However, the limited longitudinal connectivity and establishment of a minimum water level for navigation are factors that may inhibit the general resilience of this reach. In the Lower Impounded Reach, there is high within-reach variability for individual indicators such as aquatic habitat diversity, fish functional diversity and redundancy, and longitudinal and lateral connectivity. In the Unimpounded Reach, a high degree of longitudinal connectivity likely enhances its general resilience, but low aquatic habitat diversity, low lateral connectivity, and relatively high number of invasive fish species inhibit general resilience. For the Illinois River Reach, the relatively high fish functional diversity and redundancy likely contributes to its general resilience, whereas high number of invasive fish species, low water clarity, low lateral connectivity, and high range of water levels may inhibit general resilience. Indicators derived from application of concepts of general resilience provide insight into the current coping capacity of the UMRS and identify opportunities for enhancing resilience.",no

We conducted an experiment to assess whether fish herding using percussive sound or electrical stimuli can enhance catch rates and detection of bigheaded carp and other fishes in surface-to-bottom gill nets. Catch rates (fish net set(-1)) from traditional gill net sets where no herding method was applied were compared to sets combined with either sound stimuli (physical impacts to the boat hull and water surface to produce percussive sound) or electricity produced from a pulsed-DC electrofisher to manipulate fish movements. For most species, herding increased catch rates and detection probability compared to control sets. Sound stimuli increased catch rates of Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) by over three times, whereas electrical stimuli increased catch rates by over six times. Catch of Bighead Carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) was highest in nets paired with sound stimuli. Herding methods also reduced the number of samples required to attain target detection probabilities for bigheaded carp. Herding techniques combined with gill netting may be a valuable option for targeted bigheaded carp sampling, especially when electrofishing or netting alone is ineffective for these evasive fishes. Synergistic methods may provide a cost effective means of improving detection probabilities for bigheaded carp at their invasion front or other locations where densities are low and uncertainty of capture is high.",no

Spawning has occurred in the main-stem UMR but could be limited to high-discharge events when dam operations create a free-flowing river. Alternatively, naturally free-flowing tributaries could offer alternative habitat for successful reproduction. Our objectives were to examine temporal and spatial variation in adult gonad development, ichthyoplankton densities, and back-calculated spawn dates of invasive carp collected in three UMR tributaries. We compared ichthyoplankton densities between the upstream and mouth reaches of tributaries and densities between the UMR and adjacent tributaries. Ichthyoplankton samples were collected every 10 d, and adult invasive carp were sampled monthly at nine sites throughout the Des Moines, Skunk, Iowa, Cedar, and Mississippi rivers during April-October 2014 and 2015. Peaks in adult gonadosomatic index, an increase in postspawn females, and ichthyoplankton collections suggested that peak spawning occurred during late May through June, when water temperatures were 18-30 degrees C and channel velocities were at least 0.7 m/s. However, reproduction occurred as late as August in some tributaries. Ichthyoplankton densities were highest in the Des Moines River among tributaries, but tributary densities were similar to the UMR densities, suggesting that both tributaries and main-stem sites provide suitable spawning locations. Invasive carp reproduction in UMR tributaries provides additional sources of potential recruitment for further population expansion upstream in the UMR and should be considered when devising plans for controlling populations along the leading edge of the invasion.",no

These species evolved in Asia, are now invasive in the Mississippi River, and feed voraciously on microparticles including plankton. The food habits and biology of these carps are broadly similar to many filter-feeding fish, none of whose chemical ecology has been examined. We conducted five experiments. First, we demonstrated that buccal-pharngeal pumping (BPP), a behavior in which fish pump water into their buccal cavities, is responsible for sampling food: BPP activity in both silver and bighead carps was low and increased nearly 25-fold after exposure to a filtrate of a planktonic food mixture (P < 0.01) and over 35-fold when planktonic food was added (P < 0.001). Next, we showed that of nine food filtrates, the one containing chemicals released by spirulina, a type of cyanobacterium, was the most potent planktonic component for both species. The potency of filtrates varied between species in ways that reflected their different chemical compositions. While L-amino acids could explain about half of the activity of food filtrate, other unknown chemical stimuli were also implicated. Finally, occlusion experiments showed the olfactory sense has a very important, but not exclusive, role in bigheaded carp feeding behaviors and this might be exploited in both their control and culture.",no

The objective of our mesocosm study was to investigate and contrast the roles of juvenile common and bighead carp in structuring planktonic invertebrate assemblages, with focus on rotifers. We examined whether predation by juvenile carp was indiscriminate or size-selective with respect to prey size. Furthermore, we examined how changes to large and small prey influenced the potential for compensatory increases of some taxa within prey assemblages. Both species of juvenile carp reduced large zooplankton taxa. However, rotifer responses were variable depending on the taxon and predator combination. Juvenile common carp enhanced abundance for Polyartha and Squatinella, but most taxa were unaffected. Juvenile bighead carp had a more varied effect on rotifer abundance, having no effect on most, reducing Keratella and enhancing Anuraeopsis. We also estimated net filtration volume of the zooplankton community for each of the treatments and found partial compensation in net filtration because of the increased abundance of a few rotifer taxa, but this reduction did not match the depletion of macrozooplankton. Rotifers that benefitted from the presence of fish predators likely responded positively because of reduced predation by mesopredators, because of their short generation times, and/or from reduced competition.",no

Ecological phenomena like biological invasions typically evoke notions of negative effects on native communities. Yet, negative effects within specific food-web components can also have positive feedbacks that manifest elsewhere within the food web. 
We designed an experiment to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of invasive bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis: Cyprinidae) on planktonic and benthic invertebrates and the growth and survival of juvenile bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus: Centrarchidae). 
Our experiment indicated that the presence of bighead carp indirectly facilitated bluegill growth and survival. The underlying processes driving predator-predator facilitation stemmed from a combination of indirect interactions occurring through invertebrates in planktonic and vegetated habitats. Individual bluegill consumed more cladocerans and predatory macroinvertebrates in the presence of bighead carp. The presence of bighead carp appears to have indirectly influenced interactions among cladocerans, invertebrate predators, and bluegill. 
Understanding the cumulative direct and indirect effects of bigheaded carp on aquatic ecosystems requires the documentation of both negative and positive effects. Although one taxon benefitted from the presence of an invader, our findings demonstrate that this response occurred because bigheaded carp caused imbalances within the food web. We urge that future studies consider a priori how positive and negative interspecific interactions shape the structure of food webs.",no
"Collins, S. F., and D. H. Wahl",2018,Size-specific effects of bighead carp predation across the zooplankton size spectra,Freshwater Biology,63,7,700-708,"Bigheaded carp (Cyprinidae: Hypophthalmichthys spp.) were brought to North America for aquaculture and eventually escaped captivity. Since their liberation, they have dispersed northward through the Mississippi River Basin and its tributaries. Although bigheaded carp are omnivorous filter-feeding planktivores, their predatory effects on zooplankton are of principal concern because many native fishes feed on planktonic invertebrates during some phase of their life history. The aim of our study was to quantify the magnitude of effect of bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) on zooplankton body size and daily secondary production across a range of body lengths. We conducted an experiment where we compared responses of zooplankton in the presence of a native fish assemblage (control, n=5 ponds) and a native fish assemblage plus bighead carp (invaded, n=5 ponds). The experiment lasted 3months (June-September, 2014) and was conducted in clay-lined ponds (0.04ha. wetted area; 1.5-1.75m water depths). We quantified the predatory effects of bighead carp on overall changes to the size structure of zooplankton assemblages, body lengths of zooplankton taxa and taxa-specific changes to standing crop biomass and daily secondary production. The size structure of zooplankton assemblage shifted towards smaller invertebrates in the presence of bighead carp. Bighead carp reduced the individual body sizes of Diaphanosoma (Sididae) (-19%) and Daphnia (Daphniidae) (-9%) after 3months. Moreover, the standing crop biomass (-92% to 98%) and daily production (-65% to 74%) of Diaphanosoma, Daphnia and Calanoida were reduced in the presence of bighead carp. Bighead carp reduced immature copepod nauplii by 75% when compared to controls and may have affected recruitment to the adult stage. Our experiment indicated that the magnitude of predation by bighead carp increased with zooplankton body size, although rotifers and nauplii were exceptions to this pattern. The combined effects of reduced body sizes of some taxa and direct predation on immature and adult life stages of larger taxa suggest that bighead carp may be affecting zooplankton demographics through additional mechanisms such as reduced egg production, mate limitation, and recruitment.",no

The total water-spread area of the selected beels varied widely (8-50 ha), with 68.75% of the beels showing a reduction in water-spread area over the past 30 years. High levels of siltation and encroachment and detachment of marginal areas through the construction of roads were the major factors responsible for the reduction in the water-spread area of the beels. The reduction was observed to be in the range of over 33% in three beels (Raghunath Sora, Chulkani, and Dudua beel) to 83% in Bhoishpuri beel. In addition, one beel (Chulkani) experienced reduction in its deep pool area, which is an important wetland area that provides shelter to brood fishes during the dry season. Only 12.5% of the beels studied practiced enclosure (pen) culture for rearing fish. None practiced cage culture. Our study showed that only two beels (Bhoishpuri and Tariachora) were free from exotic fishes; the remaining surveyed beels reported exotic species such as, Cyprinus carpio (Common Carp), Ctenopharyngodon idella (Grass Carp), Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Silver Carp), H. nobilis (Bighead Carp) and Piaractus brachypomus (Pacu). The prevalence of exotic fishes in the majority of the beels (due both to escape from nearby aquaculture ponds during floods and intentional stocking in certain beels) would have adversely affected the diversity of indigenous fishes in those wetlands. From discussion with the fishers, 50% of the beels surveyed experienced a reduction in the number of fish species from that recorded 10-20 years ago. In addition to climate change-related factors (e.g. abnormal rains, floods, or drought-like situations), other factors - both natural (e.g. hyper-nutrification) and anthropogenic (e.g. construction of roads, houses, and other structures) - also adversely affected the studied wetlands. To help cope with these factors and increase the adaptive capacity of fishers, four measures aimed at mitigation are suggested. These are: the practice of enclosure aquaculture in beels; the construction of floating macrophyte refuges (katal); deep pool refuges; and stock enhancement programmes with climate-resilient indigenous fishes.",no

In a laboratory study, we systematically tested the effects of these stimuli on invasive bighead carp and common carp, as well as the native largemouth bass (which lack hearing specializations), in a darkened laboratory flume. We were specifically interested in whether the outboard-motor sound or the proprietary sound might be more effective at blocking and deterring fishes (i.e., does the type of complex sound matter), and whether coupling either of these sounds with an air curtain might enhance their effectiveness. We found that the proprietary sound was more effective than the outboard-motor sound at both deterring and blocking common carp as well as deterring bighead carp. The largemouth bass were less affected by both sounds. We also found that when an air curtain was coupled to either sound, the combined stimulus became more effective at blocking all three species. This was especially true for the proprietary sound which when coupled with an air curtain blocked 97% of bighead carp. The proprietary sound coupled with the air curtain has promise to block bigheaded carp and should be considered for field tests.",no

Despite the prevalence of this species culture it is considered invasive in North America and a threat to local fish communities. Investigations into the early life environmental requirements and optimization of intensive larval rearing have been limited. The present study attempts to establish most desired larval rearing conditions of bighead carp by investigating a novel static rearing method utilizing continuous light, salinity (2 parts per thousand; ppt), algal turbidity, and continuous food availability as compared to traditional recirculating culture system methods. Increased levels of salinity (3 and 5 ppt) were also examined in the novel rearing environment. A 2x2x3 full factorial ANOVA design was implemented to compare the main effects of larval rearing system, feeding regime, and stocking density (12.5, 25, and 50 fish L-1) and the interactions between the main effects on survival, biomass, length, weight, proportion of large fish (measure of heterogeneity), and specific growth rate over twenty days of feeding. A desirability function was then constructed to maximize survival (%), biomass (g L-1) and proportion of large fish to optimize larval rearing for diet nutritional requirement studies. Mortalities recorded in the experiment primarily occurred within the first ten days of feeding and leveled off during the second ten days of feeding. The desirability function identified the novel static rearing method, at high initial stocking density (50 fish L-1), and feeding with Artemia nauplii from inception as having the maximum desirability (0.733) for the selected variables. The predictions for biomass, survival and proportion of large fish from the desirability function were 2.38 g L-1 (95% CI, 2.14-2.62), 70.3% (95% CI, 60.1-80.6), and 0.768 (95% CI, 0.696-0.841) respectively.

During early ontogeny, the growth and survival of larval fish often depends on food availability. Because habitat and diet shifts are strongly tied to individual body size, factors that influence the growth rates of individuals (e.g. resource limitation, competition) also affect other aspects of ontogeny including the timing of habitat or diet shifts. In the context of biological invasions, non-native species can potentially disrupt the interaction of larval fish with their food via competition for shared prey, reducing growth and survival during a vulnerable period of an organism's life history. We hypothesised that invasive planktivores negatively affect native species through the vulnerable larval life stage via competition for zooplankton resources. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a series of experiments to assess and contrast the effects of invasive (bighead carp, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and native (golden shiners, Notemigonus crysoleucas) planktivores on zooplankton densities, and their effects on the growth, survival, abundance, and habitat use of larval bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus). Overall, the effects of the invasive planktivore were consistently greater than the native planktivore in terms of reduced prey densities, reduced bluegill growth rates, and delays to the timing of ontogenetic habitat shifts. Growth rates of bluegill larvae were reduced by 58-87% in the presence of bighead carp and 37% in the presence of golden shiners (relative to controls), but such reductions did not consistently lead to reduced survival (in mesocosm experiment) or relative abundance (in pond experiment). However, we estimated that bighead carp and golden shiners delayed ontogenetic habitat shifts in bluegill by 9-24 and 1-3 days, respectively. Although we did not detect an effect of planktivores on the numbers of larval bluegill, our findings suggest that bighead carp may still affect bluegill ontogeny and freshwater food webs by disrupting the timing of ontogenetic habitat shifts. By affecting the coupling of habitats via organism movements during early ontogeny, bighead carp may indirectly disrupt predator-prey interactions of native taxa.",no

Our objective was to develop a genetic screening tool using qPCR with the duplex assays SCTM4/5 and BHTM1/2 to prioritize samples that have a higher likelihood of containing bigheaded carp eggs or larvae. We used tandem ichthyoplankton samples collected for monitoring bigheaded carps in the Upper Mississippi, Illinois, and St. Croix rivers to evaluate the effectiveness of qPCR as a screening tool. Samples with >10,000 copies of DNA had 100% occurrence of bigheaded carp eggs or larvae in the traditionally sorted samples, whereas samples with <10 copies of DNA had 0% occurrence of ichthyoplankton from these invasive species. We used a logistic regression model to calculate the probability of finding bigheaded carp eggs or larvae based upon the number of DNA copies; 406 copies corresponded with a 50% probability of having bigheaded carp ichthyoplankton present in a sample. These data can be used to inform management actions (i.e., control, containment) for these invasive fishes, and this tool could be adapted for monitoring for reproduction of other aquatic invasive species.",no

Fish and other aquatic foods (blue foods) present an opportunity for more sustainable diets(1,2). Yet comprehensive comparison has been limited due to sparse inclusion of blue foods in environmental impact studies(3,4) relative to the vast diversity of production(5). Here we provide standardized estimates of greenhouse gas, nitrogen, phosphorus, freshwater and land stressors for species groups covering nearly three quarters of global production. We find that across all blue foods, farmed bivalves and seaweeds generate the lowest stressors. Capture fisheries predominantly generate greenhouse gas emissions, with small pelagic fishes generating lower emissions than all fed aquaculture, but flatfish and crustaceans generating the highest. Among farmed finfish and crustaceans, silver and bighead carps have the lowest greenhouse gas, nitrogen and phosphorus emissions, but highest water use, while farmed salmon and trout use the least land and water. Finally, we model intervention scenarios and find improving feed conversion ratios reduces stressors across all fed groups, increasing fish yield reduces land and water use by up to half, and optimizing gears reduces capture fishery emissions by more than half for some groups. Collectively, our analysis identifies high-performing blue foods, highlights opportunities to improve environmental performance, advances data-poor environmental assessments, and informs sustainable diets.",no

In the Illinois River, an important tributary of the Upper Mississippi River, reproduction appears to be sporadic and frequently unsuccessful, yet bigheaded carp densities in this river are among the highest recorded on the continent. Understanding the causative factors behind erratic recruitment in this commercially-harvested invasive species is important for both limiting their spread and managing their harvest. We analyzed weekly catch records from 15 years of a standardized monitoring program to document the emergence of age-0 bigheaded carp in relation to environmental conditions. The appearance of age-0 fish was generally linked to hydrographic attributes, which probably serve as a cue for spawning. However, we found profound differences in the number of age-0 fish among years, which varied by as much as five orders of magnitude in successive years. The strong link between summer flooding and age-0 fish production we observed emphasizes the importance of understanding the hydrologic context in which sustained invasions occur. Despite evidence of sporadic recruitment, bigheaded carp populations in the Illinois River appear to be consistent or increasing because of particularly strong, episodic year classes.",no

To explore how navigational Lock and Dams (LDs) on the Mississippi River could be used to deter the upstream migration of invasive fish species, computer modelling that combined computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and agent-based (AB) fish passage model (CFD-AB model) could be used to hypothetically quantify the passage of bigheaded carp (Hypophthalmichthys spp.) through LDs. Agent-based fish (AB-fish) are always located on a node of the CFD mesh and move by selecting the neighboring node that minimizes fatigue. A possible limitation of this approach is that the AB-fish movement exhibits a dependence upon the CFD mesh. The proposed modified approach allows the AB-fish to occupy any point in the computational domain and to continually (within the size of the time step) update their minimum fatigue path. Computations in a simplified channel/dam structure show that the modified CFD-AB results are smoother swimming trajectories and increased estimates of fish passage when compared to the original CFD-AB model.",no

Monitoring their reproduction can help to determine establishment in new areas but is difficult due to challenges associated with identifying fish eggs. Recently, random forest models provided accurate identification of eggs based on morphological traits, but the models have not been validated using independent data. Our objective was to evaluate the predictive performance of egg identification models developed by Camacho et al. (2019) for classifying invasive carp eggs by using an independent data set. When invasive carp were grouped as one category, predictive accuracy was high at the following levels: family (89%), genus (90%), species (91%), and species with reduced predictor variables (94%). Invasive carp predictive accuracy decreased when we only considered observations from newly sampled locations (family: 9%; genus: 22%; species: 30%; species with reduced predictor variables: 70%), suggesting potential differences in egg characteristics among locations. Random forest models using a combination of previous and new data resulted in high predictive accuracy for invasive carp (96-98%) when invasive carp were grouped as one class for all models at the family, genus, and species levels. The two most influential predictor variables were average membrane diameter and average embryo diameter; the probability of predicting an invasive carp egg increased with these metrics. High predictive accuracy metrics suggest that these trained and validated random forest models can be used to identify invasive carp eggs based on morphometric variables. However, decreased performance at new locations suggests that more research would be beneficial to determine the models' applicability to a larger spatial region.",no

Our objectives were to quantify patterns and habitat associations of adult bigheaded carp reproduction, larval production, and habitat use; such information is important for control strategies and identifying recruitment sources. During May-August 2011, we sampled adults and larvae at 10 sites distributed adjacent to and within the main channel of the Mississippi River at Pool 26 (study area = 28 river kilometers). Female reproductive status, adult location, and larval density were compared to environmental conditions, including temperature, site velocity, and turbidity. Large females spawned earlier than their smaller counterparts. No clear spawning aggregations of adults were observed, suggesting plasticity in staging habitat. Larvae were distributed across all sites during flooding. Larval density was positively related to velocity and turbidity, suggesting that nondepositional areas may facilitate recruitment. Bigheaded carp larvae comprised 10% of the ichthyofauna. Although pooled reaches are a source of recruitment for bigheaded carp in the Mississippi River system, the low densities of bigheaded carp larvae relative to native larvae cannot explain the dominance of adults in this system. Our findings provide insights into the plastic nature of bigheaded carp reproduction and habitats associated with larval development. Control efforts that target large adult females should be conducted earlier during the spring spawn. To maintain fishing pressure, such control efforts would likely need to continue through the summer, when smaller individuals spawn, discharge decreases, and CPUE increases. However, we found no specific mass staging area or habitat type where adult females could be targeted.""",no

Using a large (2,935-L) mobile swim tunnel, the swimming performance of adult bighead and adult silver carp was quantified at water velocities that challenged them to exhibit either prolonged and/or burst swimming (76-244cm/s) with fatigue times of less than 10min. Simple log-linear models best described the relative swim speed to fatigue relationships for both species. Under these conditions, the swimming performances of adult bighead and silver carp were similar to several species of adult fishes native to the Mississippi River system, but relatively low (<3 total body lengths per second, TL/s) compared to previously studied juveniles and sub-adult bigheaded carps (3-15TL/s). The decline in endurance with water velocity was three times greater in bighead carp (slope=-2.98) than in silver carp (slope=-1.01) and the predictive ability of the bighead model was appreciably better than the silver carp model. The differences in adult swimming performance between the two species were coincident with behavioral differences (e.g. breaching in silver carp but not in bighead carp).

Following Bighead Carp stocking, proportional contributions of phytoplankton to fishes significantly decreased for the other fishes (P < 0.05), and the contributions of particulate organic matter to the fishes significantly increased (P < 0.05) except for Common Bream. In addition, the total isotopic niche width of fishes increased from 12.01 to 13.06 and isotopic niche overlap between fishes increased from 22.75% to 42.50% following stocking; this change was particularly apparent in the large changes in the isotopic niche overlap between Common Bream and Bighead Carp (from 67 to 95%) and between Common Bream and Pond Smelt (from 65 to 100%), followed by that between Bighead Carp and Pond Smelt (from 0 to 90%). Furthermore, the obvious increase in isotopic niche overlap may be the reason for the reduced growth observed in Bighead Carp and in Pond Smelt.

To explore the mechanism of alien species invading a stable food web, a patch dynamic model is established to describe the patch occupancy of each species in the omnivorous food web. A species as invader will be introduced to the food web on different tropical level as predator or as prey. The impact of invasion on the persistence of all species in formed food webs under different habitat loss and habitat fragmentation is investigated. The results show: (1) Compared with invasive species being predators, invasive species being prey is easy to success in omnivorous food webs; Invasive species are much more tolerant of habitat loss and fragmentation when they invade an omnivorous food web in the role of prey than when they invade in the role of predator. (2) When invasive species is a predator in different trophic levels on omnivorous food webs, it shows different coexistence patterns varying with the role and habitat structure. The degree of habitat loss and habitat fragmentation also affects the habitat patch occupancy of the invasive species. On most habitat structure, the lower the trophic level of the invasion location, the more successful the invasion is. (3) When invasive species is a prey of species in omnivorous food webs, no matter what trophic level the invasive species is, it is easy to success. (4) The degree of habitat loss and fragmentation combined with colonization rate have certain impact on invasion result under different roles and trophic levels.

In order to evaluate the ecological effects of controlling algae by silver and bighead carps in early eutrophication lakes. In 2016, a little biomanipulation in-situ pen with the stock of silver and bighead carps was built to control cyanobacterial blooms in Hongshan Bay of Lake Erhai. The changes of plankton community structure and water environmental factors were compared and analyzed within and outside the pen. Meanwhile, the growth and feeding rhythm of silver and bighead carps were measured. The pen-cultured silver and bighead carp all displayed normal growth, the survival environment of the pen is suitable. Daily rations of silver and bighead carp were estimated by Egger's model in the main growing season. Filtration rate was calculated from the daily ration and the density plankton in the lake. Daily rations of silver and bighead carp was 24.96% and 18.18%. The daily rations silver carp is higher than that of bighead carp. Filtration rates of silver and bighead carp for phytoplankton were 3.01 L/(g·h) and 2.19 L/(g·h), respectively, and filtration rates for zooplankton were 13.54 L/(g·h) and 18.61 L/(g·h), respectively. Silver carp had a stronger ability of eliminating phytoplankton than bighead carp. Bighead carp had a stronger ability of eliminating zooplankton than silver carp. During the study, there was no significant difference in the environmental parameters within and outside the pen. The biomass of Microcystis reached its peak in July (1.7 mg/L in the fish pen and 2.4 mg/L in the surrounding lake water). The Microcystis biomass was significantly lower in the pen. The present stocking density of silver and bighead carp(about 20 g/m3 in June)was effective to control Microcystis. From June to August, the reduction rate of the phytoplankton in the silver and bighead carp gradually increased, and the rate of reduction was up to 64% in August. When phytoplankton's dominant species Chlorophyta and diatom replace Microcystis, the rate of reduction decreased gradually, with negative values in October and November. Furthermore, the biomass of crustacean zooplankton biomass and cladocerans biomass were significantly lower in the pen. Therefore, in combination with several experimental results, silver carp had a stronger ability of eliminating phytoplankton than bighead carp.

Here, planktivorous (silver carp and bighead carp), omnivorous and carnivorous fish with different dietary strategies were selected from two reservoirs, one with on-going aquaculture (WJD) and another without aquaculture (HF) in Southwest China. We compared the total mercury (THg), methylmercury (MeHg) contents and PUFA profiles of fish and their potential diets in these two reservoirs. THg and MeHg contents in omnivorous and carnivorous fish were lower from the WJD Reservoir, which is related to the lower THg and MeHg contents in the artificial fish food. THg and MeHg contents in silver carp from the WJD Reservoir were lower than those from the HF Reservoir, while they were similar in bighead carps from the two reservoirs. The Hg variation in planktivorous fish were inconsistent with that in plankton. THg contents in phyto- and zooplankton from the HF Reservoir were higher than those from the WJD Reservoir, yet their MeHg contents were similar. Artificial fish food which contained higher total PUFA eicosapentaenoic (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), significantly increased the total PUFA and EPA + DHA contents in carnivorous fish, but had less effect on that in omnivorous fish from the WJD Reservoir. Eutrophication caused by aquaculture reduced total PUFA and EPA + DHA contents of plankton in WJD, yet did not reduce those in planktivorous fish. The impacts of aquaculture on Hg and PUFA accumulated in fish were varied among different fish species, and the mechanism needs further exploration. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",no

Evidence of bigheaded carp reproduction and recruitment in the upper Mississippi River upstream of Lock and Dam 19 (LD19) at Keokuk, Iowa, thought to be a critical constriction point to their upstream establishment, has been limited to a few isolated detections of eggs, larvae, and juvenile life stages since 2012. Therefore, a more comprehensive assessment of bigheaded carp reproduction in this critical management zone was needed. We used quadrafoil light traps (n = 1,387) deployed during May-September 2016-2018 in Pools 17-19 of the Mississippi River to monitor for advanced larval bigheaded carp in low-velocity habitats. Throughout the sampling period, we captured 1,747 larval and 35 postlarval bigheaded carp (N = 1,782). Bigheaded carp were collected on 15 sampling events that spanned from May 31, 2016, to September 13, 2018, with associated hatch dates estimated to represent 10 unique reproductive events from May 2016 to September 2018. The individual captures and backdated hatch estimates revealed a protracted spawning period of up to seven events in 2016, one event in 2017, and two events in 2018. Bigheaded carp were only captured in Pool 19, possibly due to the drifting requirements for egg maturation and the low-velocity downstream reach of Pool 19. This research provides confirmation that bigheaded carp spawned upstream of LD19 are capable of transitioning past the yolk sac stage upstream of this bottleneck to more advanced larval stages. Knowledge of reproduction and larval retention and the field-based evidence of protracted spawning fill critical research gaps needed for the management of bigheaded carp.",no

We identified eggs and larvae by using morphological techniques and then used genetic tools to confirm species identity. The spawning events we observed often included more than one species of Asian carp and in a few cases included eggs that must have been derived from more than one upstream spawning event. The upstream extent of genetically confirmed Grass Carp ichthyoplankton was the Wisconsin River, while Bighead Carp and Silver Carp ichthyoplankton were observed in Pool 16. In all these cases, ichthyoplankton likely drifted downstream for several hours prior to collection. Higher water velocities (and, to a lesser extent, higher temperatures) were associated with an increased likelihood of observing eggs or larvae, although the temperature range we encountered was mostly above 17 degrees C. Several major spawning events were detected in 2013, but no major spawning events were observed in 2014. The area between Dam 15 and Dam 19 appears to be the upstream edge of spawning activity for both Silver Carp and Bighead Carp, suggesting that this area could be a focal point for management efforts designed to limit further upstream movement of these species.""",no

Invasive species may display reproductive strategies that allow successful reproduction in varying environments, such as batch and protracted spawning. Bighead Carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and Silver Carp H. molitrix, referred to as bigheaded carp, are invasive species that have been introduced worldwide. In some invaded ranges, they either have a protracted spawning period and/or spawn multiple times in a season, which can be advantageous in novel environments. Reproductive strategies can vary between river systems or with environmental conditions, and understanding differences in strategies can improve management of bigheaded carp. To determine reproductive strategy, we evaluated the histology of spawning capable ovaries from Silver Carp (n = 58) and Bighead Carp (n = 38) collected during May-September 2016 and June 2017 from Pools 17-20 of the upper Mississippi River (UMR). We found that 87.9% of Silver Carp (n = 51) and 86.8% of Bighead Carp (n = 33) had an ovary that contained primary growth, cortical alveolar, and vitellogenic oocytes simultaneously. Multiple stages of oocytes within an ovary indicated that individuals were capable of spawning multiple times during a single year, and the presence of postovulatory follicle complexes demonstrated that individuals had already spawned while oocytes were still present. Based on histological samples, bigheaded carp appear to be indeterminate batch spawners, with oocytes continuing to develop throughout the spawning period. Silver and Bighead carp in the UMR may exhibit protracted and batch spawning and employ flexible spawning strategies among different river systems, which can increase the probability of successful recruitment in a variable environment.",no

Therefore, the ability to estimate fecundity from field measurements (i.e., TL, relative weight [W-r], or ovary weight) can be a valuable tool for fisheries managers to estimate reproductive potential. The goal of this study was to relate the batch fecundity of invasive Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Bighead Carp H. nobilis to metrics that can be quickly measured to eliminate the need for direct enumeration. Silver and Bighead carp were collected from the upper Mississippi River (UMR) in the summer of 2016 and 2017. Subsamples of mature (spawning capable) ovaries were preserved, enumerated, and then related to ovary weight, TL, weight, and W-r. An equation for estimating Silver Carp batch fecundity from ovary weight in the UMR, corrected for ovary membrane weight, was developed: {ovary weight - [0.222 x (ovary weight(0.7589))]} x 794 (SE = 11). Batch fecundity for Silver Carp from Pools 17-20 of the UMR averaged 1,230,930 +/- 68,983 eggs (mean +/- SE).

Nonetheless, few studies have assessed the ecological or genetic impacts of such introductions on native conspecific fish populations.

Results from a haplotype network analysis revealed that most haplotypes of the Pearl River clustered with those of Yangtze River origin and only a small proportion were distinct, suggesting that both the native Pearl River bighead and silver carp populations are currently dominated by genetic material from the Yangtze River. The genetic diversity of Pearl River populations is high in both species because of this inter-population gene flow, but the diversity of native Pearl River populations is low.

Aeromonas hydrophila (A. hydrophila) is the most common zoonotic pathogen in aquaculture, which causes serious economic losses to aquaculture, especially to bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, H. nobilis) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrbc, H. molitrbc). Recent studies along with our previous findings have shown that synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing CpG motifs (CpG ODN) can play a good role in aquatic animals against infection. In order to clarify the relationship between CpG ODN and RBP4 under A. hydrophila infection, firstly, full-length RBP4 cDNAs from H. nobilis and H. molitrbc were cloned. And characteristics of RBP4, including sequence and structure, tissue distribution and genetic evolution were analyzed. In addition, mRNA expression levels of RBP4, cytokine, toll-like receptors (TLRs), morbidity and survival rates of H. nobilis and H. molitrbc were observed post CpG ODN immunization or following challenge. The results indicated that hn/ hm_RBP4 (RBP4 genes obtained from H. nobilis and H. molitrbc) had the highest homology with Megalobrama amblycephala. Distribution data showed that the expression level of hn_RBP4 mRNA was higher than that of hm_RBP4. After CpG ODN immunization followed by A.hydrophila challenge, significantly higher survival was observed in both carps, together with up-regulated RBP4 expression. Meanwhile, hn/hm_IL-1 beta level was relatively flat (and decreased), hn/hm_IFN-gamma, hn/hm_TLR4 and hn/hm_TLR9 levels increased significantly, but hn/ hm_STRA6 showed no significant change, compared with control. Moreover, CpG ODN immunization could induce stronger immune protective responses (higher IFN-gamma/gentle IL-1 beta level and lower morbidity/higher survival rate) against A. hydrophila in H. nobilis, along with higher RBP4 level, when compared with that in H. molitrbc. These results demonstrated that RBP4 was well involved in the immune protection of CpG ODN. Based on the results, we speculated that in the case of A. hydrophila infection, TLR9 signaling pathway was activated by CpG ODN. Subsequently, CpG ODN up-regulated RBP4, and RBP4 activated TLR4 signaling pathway. Then TLR4 and TLR9 synergistically improved the anti-infection responses.

Each diet was randomly assigned to triplicate tanks, and each tank was stocked with 30 fish. The highest weight gain rate (WGR, 288.94%) and specific growth rate (2.28% day(-1)) and the best feed conversion rate (FCR, 1.91) were recorded in fish fed 8.30 g kg(-1) phosphorus. The body composition analysis showed that the phosphorus contents in the whole body, muscle, vertebra, and plasma of fish fed the phosphorus-supplemented diets were higher than those of fish fed the control diet, whereas the phosphorus retention rate and crude lipid contents in the whole body and muscle presented the reverse results. The highest activity of lipase (41.97 U g(-1) prot) in the intestine was found in fish fed the diet with 11.90 g kg(-1) phosphorus. Further, the contents of total protein, albumin, and globulin in plasma were increased as dietary phosphorus levels ranged from 0.90 to 11.90 g kg(-1) and then decreased with further increased phosphorus levels. The highest contents of triglyceride (1.85 mmol L-1) and total cholesterol (2.16 mmol L-1) in plasma occurred at dietary phosphorus level of 0.90 g kg(-1).

In the current study, bighead carp (initial weight 180.05 +/- 0.092 g) were exposed to nitrite (48.634 mg/L) for 96 h and then for 96 h recovery test. After nitrite exposure for 6 h, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) mRNA expression increased significantly in the gill of bighead carp (P < 0.05). After nitrite exposure for 12 h, hemoglobin (Hb) and methemoglobin reductase (MHBR) content in blood decreased significantly (P < 0.05); TLR4 mRNA expression increased significantly (P < 0.05). After nitrite exposure for 24 h, methemoglobin (MetHb) content increased significantly (P < 0.05). After recovery test, all the indicators except TLR4 mRNA expression level recovered to initial level. In conclusion, nitrite exposure can affect hemoglobin dynamics, as oxidization of nitrite by hemoglobin results in the reduction of Hb to MetHb leading to hypoxia and nitrite exposure can also result into gill tissue damage. In the face of nitrite exposure, NF-kappa B and HIF-1 alpha mRNA expression level increased immediately to protect the body from oxidative damage and eased hypoxic condition caused by nitrite.

Efforts have been made to inhibit Bighead Carp and Silver Carp expansion into the Great Lakes through hydrologically connected systems, but understanding their expansion to and from hydrologically disconnected systems could further reduce this risk. We assessed the origin of 23 Bighead Carp and 1 Silver Carp captured from Chicago Urban Fishing Program ponds using otolith chemistry. Otolith core delta O-18 and delta C-13 of captured Bighead Carp did not overlap with ranges of otolith delta O-18 and delta C-13 from Bighead Carp and Silver Carp from the Illinois River but was consistent with otolith delta O-18 and delta C-13 of Bighead Carp obtained from aquaculture facilities. Likewise, otolith core Sr:Ca of 19 captured Bighead Carp was higher than the range of otolith Sr:Ca from Illinois River Bighead Carp and Silver Carp. Due to inferred timing of introduction (likely age-0 or age-1 fish), these Bighead Carp may have been released incidentally via stocking sport fish shipments contaminated with the carp. Contrastingly, otolith chemistry results suggest that the captured Silver Carp originated from the Illinois River, although timing of introduction of this fish could not be inferred. Overall, our results indicate that nearly all fish analyzed did not originate from rivers within the Mississippi River basin and were instead likely introduced through stocking contaminated shipments of fish. Even though Chicago Urban Fishing Program ponds now pose a minimal threat for Bighead Carp and Silver Carp expansion into Lake Michigan, sustained urban pond monitoring and nonnative fish removal may limit or eliminate this alternative invasion pathway. Additionally, continued vigilance in understanding the origin of stocked fish and culture environment (e.g., polyculture) could decrease the likelihood of future invasive species introductions through contaminated sport fish stockings.",no

Methods and Results The intestinal contents were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq of bacterial 16S rRNA. Cyanophyta and Chlorophyta were the prevalent phytoplankton in the water, whereas Rotifers and Protozoa were the predominant zooplankton. In all, 779,563 quality-filtered sequences and 8870 amplicon sequence variants were obtained from 24 samples that numbered T1A1 to T4A3 and T1B1 to T4B3, resulting in 35 phyla, with Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria and Cyanobacteria dominating. According to alpha diversity and beta diversity measurements, the bacterial communities were diverse, Chao1 richness and Pielou's evenness were significantly lower in the T2B and T4B groups. The gut bacterial communities of T1A, T1B, T2A and T2B groups differed from those of other samples, which formed distinctly clusters with principal coordinate analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis.

The design of present experiment consists in two ponds (PCP and CP-PP), stocked with common carp (CC), silver carp (SC), bighead carp (BC) and grass carp (GC), where different fish rearing technologies were applied. Also, in case of CP-PP, split-pond technique, together with a particular hydraulic regime was used. The phosphorus input through administrated feed was 165% higher in the case of PCP, compared to the CP-PP. The results obtained by using Sankey diagram revealed higher percentages of phosphorus accumulation in water (> 1000%) and sediments (> 15%), in the case of PCP pond, compared to the CP-PP pond. However, higher percentages of phosphorus accumulation in fish biomass were registered at PCP pond (> 8% in CC, 500% in SC, 150% in BC and > 118% in GC).

Statistical analyses have shown a strong correlation between the landed quantity and the number of fries stocked each year. The impact assessment showed that the risks and benefits associated with the introduction of the three species are variable. Regarding their benefits, it was clear that the herbivorous carp has provided effective and sustainable control of the extensive development of aquatic vegetation in the eutrophic reservoirs and canal systems. The value of the other two species, though, remains less obvious, particularly for the bighead carp. The consequences of their introduction on ecosystems and native species seem to be negligible, especially when the densities are low.

We found that all bigheaded carps utilized primarily zooplankton and neglected the scarce and inefficiently digestible phytoplankton, irrespective of gill raker morphology. Moreover, we observed strikingly high levels of inorganic debris consumption, but the proportion of inorganic matter in the guts was not associated directly with the concentration of suspended inorganic particles. Variance in the diet composition of bigheaded carps was related mostly to environmental factors, including the wind-induced resuspension of inorganic particles and seasonally variable availability of food resources.

These are now among the dominant fish species in many tropical and some subtropical reservoirs. Eutrophication is assumed to accelerate their population growth. In the present study, we reported a sharp decline in the catch of stocked bighead carp (Itypophthalmichthys nobilis (Richardson, 1845)) with an extreme increase of tilapia catch in a large reservoir in southern China. In 2006, the catch of tilapia was 150 tons, which exceeded the catch of stocked bighead carp, and reached 500 tons in 2015. Long-term meteorological data over the past two decades did not show any significant change, especially in minimum air and water temperatures, which can be factors limiting tilapia growth. In contrast, water quality conditions, including total nitrogen, total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a, chemical oxygen demand, and trophic status, have significantly increased in the reservoir. The phytoplankton community has been mainly composed of small and filamentous species, while the total zooplankton biomass has decreased, with the community now mainly comprised of small rotifers and copepod species. The high ratio of chlorophyll a:TP indicates a weakening top-down effect of zooplankton on phymplankton. The annual tilapia catch was significantly associated with trophic status of the reservoir, but not with meteorological and hydrological factors. We propose an ecological mechanism for increased population densities of the non-native tilapia under eutrophication, in which an increase in tilapia population size has been accompanied by a reduction in their body size, producing a stronger negative impact on zooplankton and water quality, which contributes to the turnover between bighead carp and tilapia catch. The proposed mechanism provides a useful framework for understanding the process and management of tilapia populations in tropical reservoirs.",no

Finally, we review and give suggestions for how the use of methods including adaptive management, scenario planning, sensitivity analyses, and value of information as well as efforts to ensure clarity in language and model structure can enable modelers and managers to reduce and account for key uncertainties and make better decisions for the control of invasive species.",no

Increasing evidence suggests harmful impacts of BHC on native fisheries (e.g., competition). Monitoring the abundance of BHC is difficult with traditional fisheries gears, and few studies have evaluated early life stage sampling. Identifying the spawning locations of BHC through early life stage sampling has the ability to enhance management efforts by applying focus to areas that have potential to serve as population sources. We evaluated the performance of three gears in sampling larval BHC and native taxa within large-river tributaries in terms of abundance, community assemblage, and size structure. We sampled ichthyoplankton in tributaries with active (push net) and passive (drift net, light trap) gears from March through September 2016. Relative abundance of BHC was greatest in push nets followed by drift nets and was lowest in light traps. Native cyprinids and catostomids as well as BHC comprised a large portion of the total catch. Environmental and habitat characteristics (stream velocity, dissolved oxygen, and temperature) related to BHC reproduction influenced each gear's ability to capture larval BHC, although relationships in final models were not significant. Taxonomic size selectivity existed among gears; in particular, larger BHC were collected in push nets relative to the other gears. Push nets were the most effective in sampling BHC, and remaining gears exhibited unique strengths. Although less effective than active push nets, drift nets proved useful for monitoring BHC in tributaries and may be advantageous in shallow systems with adequate flow. Light traps were ineffective at capturing BHC larvae in tributaries but may offer utility in lentic habitats or for native cyprinids. Our comparison serves as a guide for monitoring larval BHC in their invaded range and for detection in new areas, such as tributaries of the Great Lakes.",no

A mechanistic understanding of interactions between nonnative prey and native predators is needed to assess the potential for predator regulation of Hypophthalmichthys carp populations and impacts on native predator assemblages. We conducted a series of experiments to quantify the selectivity and efficiency of Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides predation on juveniles of both of these Hypophthalmichthys species and behaviors that potentially influence this selectivity and efficiency. Selectivity was measured over 24 h in 2-m-diameter pools containing one of two prey assemblages consisting of three individuals from each of three species: (1) Bighead Carp with native littoral (Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus) and pelagic prey (Golden Shiner Notemigonus crysoleucas) or (2) Bighead Carp, Silver Carp, and a morphologically similar native prey (Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum). Foraging efficiency and predator-prey behaviors were quantified in 45-min trials in which Largemouth Bass foraged on 10 individuals of a single prey species inside a 750-L observation tank. All prey species were readily attacked and consumed by Largemouth Bass; Silver Carp were selected less often than Gizzard Shad, and Bighead Carp were selected at a higher rate than any of the other prey species. Of the species tested, Bighead Carp formed the tightest schools and were captured most efficiently by Largemouth Bass. Overall, Hypophthalmichthys carps were similar to native prey in their vulnerability to Largemouth Bass; therefore, factors affecting Hypophthalmichthys carp availability relative to native prey may shape postinvasion predator-prey interactions.",no

A better understanding of factors that influence spatial patterns of bigheaded carp reproduction can help fisheries managers to prevent their spread. To examine factors that influence spatial patterns of reproduction, we sampled ichthyoplankton by using drift nets and push nets in three tributaries of the Illinois and Wabash rivers during March-September 2016-2018. We compared relative abundances of bigheaded carp eggs and larvae among tributaries by using CPUE. Abiotic data were analyzed from individual study tributaries and were pooled among tributaries with substantial versus minimal evidence of bigheaded carp reproduction. In total, 5,689 larval bigheaded carp were captured during three sampling seasons. Of the six study tributaries, we captured the most bigheaded carp larvae in the Sangamon River, followed by the Little Wabash, Embarras, Spoon, Mackinaw, and Vermilion rivers. Based on previous literature, we investigated differences in watershed area, discharge, water temperature, turbidity, and free-flowing stretches of river in our study tributaries. In general, tributaries with greater relative abundances of bigheaded carp eggs and larvae had larger watersheds, greater discharge, lower Secchi depths (higher turbidity), and longer free-flowing stretches than those with minimal evidence of reproduction. This study provides a thorough investigation of bigheaded carp reproduction in six large-river tributaries and will help fisheries managers to better monitor and mediate the spread of these invaders by facilitating the prioritization of potential monitoring locations.""",no

Four treatments - clam-only, fish-only, combined and controls - were used. In combination, bighead carp (80 g m(-3)) and Asian clam (260 g m(-2)), had a remarkable controlling effect on phytoplankton biomass and improved water quality. By the end of the experiment, the chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration of the combined group was below 5 mu g L-1 compared with 36 mu g L-1 in the clam-only treatments and 31 mu g L-1 in the controls, whereas Chl a in the fish-only group had increased to 211 mu g L-1. Large-sized algae (Microcystis sp.) dominated in the control group and the clam-only group, whereas small-sized algae (Actinastrum hantzschii and Clamydomonas globose) dominated in the fish-only group. The concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in the water column were significantly reduced by clam stocking, regardless of the presence of fish. A 24-h laboratory experiment was conducted to verify whether the excrements produced by clams filtering small-sized algae could be eaten by bighead carp. At the end of the experiment, the density of Scenedesmus obliquus had decreased significantly in the clam-presentmesocosms, and the gut fullness index of bighead carp was significantly higher in the clam-present mesocosms than when clams were absent. Our results show that, under the selected experimental conditions and densities, water clarity improved when bighead carp and Asian clam occurred together, whereas Chl a concentrations and algae biomass increased in the fish-only mesocosms; in the clam-only mesocosms no significant effectswere observed. We suggest that the combination of filter-feeding fish and clams may enhance water clarity and it may therefore potentially be a useful restoration tool. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Retailers were questioned about supply chains, and anglers surveyed about baitfish use and disposal. Assays revealed unadvertised species eDNA in 100% of bait stores, with 61% containing illegal native non-bait (totaling 13 species) and 88% having AIS (11 species). Illegal native non-bait species included juvenile walleye, yellow perch, and white sucker eDNA. AIS eDNA included Eurasian ruffe in seven stores (all states), silver carp in five (including a Lake Erie store in two separate years), and bighead carp in two Lake Erie stores that also had silver carp.

To mitigate the impact on fish, fish passages have been developed as an effective way to restore riverine connectivity. The design of fish passage facilities refers to both hydrodynamics and fish behavior, and the information on the energetic expenditure of fish can be used to identify movement zones that are suitable for fish migration. Thus, this paper intended to identify fish movement behavior in response to water flow field information by means of estimating the energetic expenditure using an IBM approach. The results demonstrated that the fish required more energy in high TKE zones, and they were therefore likely to utilize the low TKE zones. This study provides a reference for optimizing the design of fish passages, and the method can be applied to assess the efficiency of fish passages and other fish bypass structures. An understanding of fish movement behavior in response to flow field variables is important for exploring the hydrodynamic strategies of fish in fish passages. In this paper, bighead carps were taken as an example.

The number of consecutive times the fish reacted to sound from alternating locations at each end of the pond was assessed. Bighead carp were relatively indifferent to the pure tones with median consecutive responses ranging from 0 to 2 reactions away from the sound source. However, fish consistently exhibited significantly (P < 0.001) greater negative phonotaxis to the broadband sound (outboard motor recording) with an overall median response of 20 consecutive reactions during the 10 min trials. In over 50% of broadband sound tests, carp were still reacting to the stimulus at the end of the trial, implying that fish were not habituating to the sound.

Lock and Dam 19 (LD19) is a high-head dam on the UMR that delineates downriver areas where bigheaded carps are well established from upriver pools where these species are less abundant and evidence of reproduction and recruitment are limited. Principal natal environments supporting recruitment of emerging bigheaded carp populations in the UMR are unknown. The objectives of this study were to (1) infer environments occupied during early-life stages by bigheaded carps collected in UMR Pools 19-21 during 2013-2014 using otolith microchemistry and stable isotope analyses, and (2) use early-life environment assignments and capture location to identify individuals that passed through LD19.

Multiple sources of recruits, including from tributaries, have contributed to upriver expansion of bigheaded carps in the UMR. Sustainable control of bigheaded carps upstream of LD19 will likely require efforts to control local recruitment and immigration from downriver.

Guo",2022,"Modeling ecosystem impacts of the invasive japanese smelt hypomesus nipponensis in lake erhai, southwestern China",Ecological Informatics,67,,13,"Introductions or alien species invasions will induce changes in aquatic ecosystems but are rarely reported in Chinese highland lakes. The Japanese smelt (Hypomesus nipponensis) invaded and has become a dominant fish species in Lake Erhai, a highland lake in southwestern China, since 2016. Here, we engineered Ecopath models for two different periods, 2008-2009 (preinvasion) and 2016-2018 (postinvasion), in Lake Erhai to model ecosystem impacts from the Japanese smelt invasion. In the dynamic Ecosim model based on the 2016-2018 Ecopath model, we ran three 50-year scenarios to simulate the potential effects of Japanese smelts on the system. Our results showed competition between invasive and native species as well as changes in trophic structures, highlighting the impacts of the invasive species over time. The lake ecosystem additionally experienced significant degradation after invasion, mainly reflected in several related indicators, such as total biomass/total system throughput (TB/TST), total primary production/total biomass (TPP/TB), total primary production/total respiration (TPP/TR), Finn's mean path length (FML), Finn's cycling index (FCI) and the Connectance Index (CI). The simulation results indicated that the relative biomass of icefish (Neosalanx taihuensis), bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis), sharpbelly (Hemiculter leucisculus), and zooplankton were significantly affected by increasing the strength of the top-down control of the Japanese smelt on its prey. It is also important to do ecological regulation of planktivorous fishes in the studied Lake Erhai, especially the Japanese smelt.",no

Liu",2022,Assessment of biophysical properties of faecal pellets from channel catfish (ictalurus punctatus) and bighead carp (aristichthys nobilis),Sustainability,14,12,14,"Fish faeces are a crucial component of solid wastes from cage culture systems. In order to investigate the environmental impacts of faeces from channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis), certain biophysical characteristics during faecal sinking at three temperatures (10, 20 and 30 degrees C for winter, spring-autumn and summer conditions, respectively) were assessed in the present study. Settling velocities of faeces from channel catfish (1.72-13.33 cm/s) and bighead carp (4.16-13.83 cm/s) accelerated with an increase in water temperature. For channel catfish faeces, there were positive correlations between settling velocity and physical properties, i.e., weight, volume, length and diameter; however, for bighead carp faeces, no linear relationship between settling velocity and length was found. The main faecal water absorption period for these two species occurred after 2.5 min of immersion. The main leaching period of faecal carbon and nitrogen was 0-2.5 min, and the leaching period of faecal phosphorus was 0-10 min. The nutrient contents in channel catfish faeces were significantly higher than those in bighead carp faeces. These results suggest that co-culturing channel catfish with bighead carp can effectively reduce the discharge of nutrients from aquaculture. The biophysical properties of these two types of fish faeces can also provide guidance in particle waste collection.",no

The purpose of this study was to measure the effects of light color on the swimming performance of bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis), a planktivorous fish species widely used in aquaculture. Stepped velocity testing was conducted in a modified Brett-type swim tunnel respirometer to determine critical swimming speed (U-crit), oxygen consumption (MO2), and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) for juvenile bighead carp under red, yellow, blue, and green lights at 25 degrees C. U-crit was significantly lower for fish swimming under yellow and green lights compared with red and blue light. Cost of transport (COT), a measure of swimming efficiency, also varied with color. The results, obtained under controlled conditions, add to our knowledge on the effects of artificial color light on fish physiology and behavior and inform decisions on the use of artificial color light in aquaculture and fishway design.",no

This study was conducted for two years. The polyculture ponds of grass carp, crucian carp and bighead carp were grouped into the treatment group using the zero-water exchange mode, while the ordinary polyculture ponds of grass carp, bighead carp, and crucian carp were grouped into the control group. The results showed that 1) the treatment group reduced water conductivity, dissolved solids and sediment organic carbon significantly (P < 0.05), and improved water transparency significantly (P < 0.05); 2) the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus accumulation amount and rate in the water of the treatment group were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than those in the control group, so was the sediment accumulation rate of organic carbon and nitrogen (P < 0.05); 3) the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus utilization efficiency of stocked fish in the treatment group were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those in the control group, with an increase of 29.49%, 21.72%, and 20.65%, respectively. Therefore, the zero-water ex-change pond was a green and efficient aquaculture mode, which could improve water quality, reduce nutrient accumulation, and improve the utilization efficiency of nutrients effectively. Considering the nutrient emissions from aquaculture in China, the zero-water exchange mode has a good value for promotion.",no

The outcomes revealed that the overall ammonia nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, total inorganic nitrogen, and orthophosphate concentrations in every one of the carbon source treatments were significantly less (P < 0.05) than the control. The net production of silver carp and bighead carp in the molasses treatment was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that in the control. The total feed conversion rates of the fish in the molasses and the mixed carbon source treatments were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than in the control, while the total protein efficiency ratio values in the corn starch, molasses, and mixed carbon source treatments were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those in the control. The bioflocs significantly (P < 0.05) impacted the muscle makeup of crude protein, crude fat, and ash of mirror carp. The current examination showed that the increased generation and feed used in mirror, silver, and bighead carp may be reached with an enhanced water grade when different carbon sources were added, while the use of molasses, an organic carbon source, was optimal compared to the other carbon sources due to its low price and good effect.",no

For this purpose, three bioflocs treatments with carbohydrate referred to as 'BFT-24% (24% feed protein)', 'BFT-27% (27% feed protein)' and 'BFT-30% (30% feed protein)' and a control referred to as 'CW-30% (30% feed protein)' without carbohydrate addition were performed in three replicate enclosures (7 m x 7 m x 1.5 m) each. Young bottom feeder mirror carp (Cyprinus carpio specularis) and filter feeder bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) with initial mean individual body weights of 691.34 ( +/- 6.73 g) and 327.13 ( +/- 3.54 g), respectively, were stocked altogether in polyculture at biomass of 800 gm(-2) and 200 gm(-2) in the control and treatment enclosures. There was a significant positive correlation between the bioflocs volumes and water temperatures from 19.3-28.5 degrees C (P < 0.05). The pH values and the concentrations of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), nitrite nitrogen (NO2-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) and orthophosphate (PO4-P) in all the treatments of BFT were significantly lower than those in the control (P < 0.05), while the total alkalinity, the concentration of chlorophyll a and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) did not show significant differences among the treatments and the control (P < 0.05), while the digestive enzyme activity in the BFT treatments did not show significant differences compared with that in the control (P > 0.05).

"Zielinski, D. P., and P. W. Sorensen",2017,"Silver, bighead, and common carp orient to acoustic particle motion when avoiding a complex sound",Plos One,12,6,20,"Behavioral responses of silver carp (Hypopthalmichthys molitrix), bighead carp (H. nobilis), and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) to a complex, broadband sound were tested in the absence of visual cues to determine whether these species are negatively phonotaxic and the roles that sound pressure and particle motion might play mediating this response. In a dark featureless square enclosure, groups of 3 fish were tracked and the distance of each fish from speakers and their swimming trajectories relative to sound pressure and particle acceleration were analyzed before, and then while an outboard motor sound was played. All three species exhibited negative phonotaxis during the first two exposures after which they ceased responding. The median percent time fish spent near the active speaker for the first two trials decreased from 7.0% to 1.3% for silver carp, 7.9% to 1.1% for bighead carp, and 9.5% to 3% for common carp. Notably, when close to the active speaker fish swam away from the source and maintained a nearly perfect 0 degrees orientation to the axes of particle acceleration. Fish did not enter sound fields greater than 140 dB (ref. 1 mu Pa). These results demonstrate that carp avoid complex sounds in darkness and while initial responses may be informed by sound pressure, sustained oriented avoidance behavior is likely mediated by particle motion. This understanding of how invasive carp use particle motion to guide avoidance could be used to design new acoustic deterrents to divert them in dark, turbid river waters.",no
